Below is a chart of the symbols used for the Toki Pona mode of tengwar. If you'd like to you can [download the font]() which contains all of these symbols. In the chart below, under each of the symbols, you will see what button to type on your keyboard to make the tengwar letters if you have the font.

If you are familiar with the tengwar of J. R. R. Tolkien, this should be a breeze for you. If not, don't fear: I will explain it fully for you and give some examples.

 

## Instructions

The vowel signs always come above the consonant which precedes them. Let's look at a few examples:

 
<img />

The word for **plant** in Toki Pona is _kasi_. As
you can see, the _a_ which comes after the _k_ has
its vowel sign written <u>above</u> the _k_. Also, the _i_ is
written above the s.

 
Some words begin with vowels, however. You can't put the vowel
sign above the consonant, because there is no consonant. Here's
what to do in that situation:

> akesi â€” reptile

If the vowel does not have a consonant before it, you place the
vowel sign on a separate line, which looks like an undotted i.
If you are using the Toki Pona tengwar font, type _q_ to make
the undotted-i figure.

 

To make a sentence using the Toki Pona mode of tengwar, there must be a
: at the beginning and end of the sentence. To make a question or use an
exclamation mark, simply add their symbols next to the final : of the
sentence. Here are three sentences in Toki Pona using tengwar. The first
is a normal sentence, the second is a question, and the third an exclamation:

The only time you can omit the period is if you would rather put a paragraph
marker in its place. The paragraph markers are optional, and you can use it
however you choose to. To make the paragraph markers, type either ` or ~.

 

The next thing you should know is that sometimes, you can't use the normal
symbol for _n_. If the _n_ comes at the end of a syllable (such as in _tenpo_,
_sitelen_, and _anpa_) rather than at the beginning (such as in _nimi_, _noka_, and
_pona_), you will need to put a special line over the previous consonant (or
the previous undotted-i stem) that represents an _n_. Here are the words _tenpo_,
_sitelen_, and _anpa_:

With the font, to make the horizontal bar which represents _n_, type _N_. Also,
you can use a tilde rather than a bar if you choose to do so. They both mean
the same thing. Type M for the tilde.

 

The last thing you should know are just a few miscellaneous topics. If you
want to put either a hyphen or a comma into your writing, they both are
the same symbol in the Toki Pona mode of tengwar. Simply type either , or -
to make the symbol. Note that if you use a comma, you should not put a space
after it, like you would normally do in English writing. To make quotation marks,
you can type ' and " if you have the font. The ' symbol is the opening quotation,
and the " symbol is the closing quotation.
