## Greetings

Here are a few expressions commonly used in Toki Pona:
|           |                          |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| **toki!** | hello! hi!               |
| **pona!** | good! thanks! great! OK! |
| **a!**    | oh! ah! ha!              |

Other greetings are easy formed around the idea of **pona** _good_.
|                |                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **suno pona!** | Good sun! Good day!            |

| **mi tawa**    | I'm going. Bye!                |
| **tawa pona!** | (in reply) Go well! Good bye!  |
| **kama pona!** | Come well! Welcome!            |
| **musi pona!** | Good fun! Have fun!            |

## Mulitple verbs

A second verb can be added to give a more specific meaning. Note that we do not add **e** between verbs.
|                             |                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **mi ken kama**             | I can come                             |
| **iki li wile moku**        | She wants/needs to eat. She is hungry. |
| **sina ken pali e ijo ike** | You are able to do something evil.     |
| **mi wile tawa tomo pali**  | I must go to the office (work place).  |

In English, we can say _I want something_. However, in Toki Pona, it is more clear to use a second verb after _want_, e.g. **wile jo** _want to have_:
|                                 |                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **iki li wile jo e ijo**        | He wants (to have) something. |
| **iki li wile jo e soweli sin** | He wants a new ferret.        |
| **sina wile lukin e suno**      | You want to see the light.    |


## More Examples

To form a negative, simply add the word **ala**. In most cases, **ala** would be used as an adverb after the verb.

|                                  |                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ijo iki li suli**              | His thingy is big.                   |
| **iki li wile lape**             | He wants/needs to sleep. He's tired. |
| **mi tawa tomo telo**            | I am going to the washroom.          |
| **mi telo e mi**                 | I will water myself. I will shower.  |
| **telo pona!**                   | Good water! Have a good shower!      |
