## Cumulative Noun Modifiers (Review)

In Lesson Two, we learnt to combine nouns in a cumulative way. Whenever we added a new word after a noun or group of nouns, its meaning was added to the total meaning of all that precedes.
|         |                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| ma      | earth                         |
| ma tawa | going/moving earth, quicksand |

|              |                    |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| ilo          | device             |
| ilo suno     | light device, lamp |
| ilo suno ike | a bad lamp         |

|                            |                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| supa                       | horizontal surface                   |
| supa lape                  | horizontal surface for sleeping, bed |
| supa lape suli             | big bed                              |
| supa lape suli mute        | many/numerous big beds               |
| supa lape suli mute iki    | his numerous big beds                |
| supa lape suli mute iki ni | these numerous big beds of his       |

As you will notice, nouns can can add up to considerably long strings. That is why a word like **li** is useful in showing where the subject ends and the verb begins.

|                                   |                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| supa lape suli mute iki ni li ike | These numerous big beds of his suck. |

 
## Parallel Noun Modifiers ("and")

It is sometimes useful to show that more than one modifier refers individually and independently to the first (main) noun. The word **en** _and_ is used to divide between such parallel qualifiers:

|                          |                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| ma suli en suno          | a big and sunny land             |
| ijo suli en jelo en nasa | something long, yellow and silly |
| jan suli en pona         | a tall and good person           |
| jan suli pona            | a good adult                     |

In the second to last example, both **suli** and **pona** individually qualify the main noun **jan**. The person is both _big_ and _good_. These two parallel adjectives are separated by **en** (_and_).

In the last example, without using **en**, we have a cumulative modifier. First, **suli** modifies **jan** to create **jan suli** _adult_. Then, **pona** is added on to give the meaning of _good adult_.

**en** can also be used to combine multiple one-word nouns:


|                            |                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| supa en ilo li nasa en sin | The table and the machine are strange and new. |


## When one Noun Group Modifies Another One ("of")

The word **pi** _of_ is used to divide between two noun groups.

|                         |                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ma pi jan mute          | the country of many people                             |
| jan pi tenpo pona       | person of good times, fun person                       |
| ma suli pi jan pona     | big country of good people                             |
| tomo suli pi jan ike    | the big house of the bad person, the enemy's mansion   |
| telo nasa pi mi mute    | the silly water of me (plural), our booze              |
| ilo toki pi jan pona mi | the talking device of my friend, my friend's telephone |

In the examples above, the sum of what follows **pi** gives more detail about the sum of what comes before pi.
