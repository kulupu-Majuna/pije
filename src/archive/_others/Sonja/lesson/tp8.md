## Yes-or-No Questions

Essentially, a question like "Is it big?" expects two possible answers. Either it is big or it isn't.
|                 |                |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| iki li suli     | It is big.     |
| iki li suli ala | It is not big. |

When formulating a yes-or-no question in Toki Pona, we simply list those two possibilities (negative and positive) side by side. Do not invert the verb like in English. The word order remains the same.
|                       |                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| iki li suli ala suli? | It is not-big / big? Is it big? |

The answer to this question could be one of the following:
|          |                             |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| suli     | Big. Yes, it is big.        |
| suli ala | Not big. No, it is not big. |

Note that there is no specific word for "yes". Just repeat the word that is being asked about. For a negative response, simply add **ala**.
|                          |                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| sina wile ala wile kama? | You not-want / want to come? Do you want to come? |
| wile                     | Want. Yes, I want to come.                        |

|                            |                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jan lawa li wawa ala wawa? | The head-person is not-strong / strong? Is the leader powerful? |
| wawa ala                   | Not powerful. No, the leader isn't powerful.                    |

|                              |                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| mama meli mi li lon ala lon? | My female parent is not-present / present? Is my Mom there? |
| lon                          | Is present. Yes, she is there.                              |

Usually the word being asked about is the verb, but really the question can focus on any word.
|                                |                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| meli ala meli li lawa e ma ni? | A woman / not a woman rules that country? Does a woman rule that country? |
| meli                           | A woman. Yes, it's a woman.                                               |

The idea of maybe, perhaps can be expressed with the word ken can, may.
|                                            |                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jan sona li wile ala wile moku e telo sin? | The knowledge-person not-wants / wants to drink new water? Does the scientist want (to drink) some more water? |
| ken wile                                   | May want. Maybe.                                                                                               |
