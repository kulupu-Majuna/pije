# <img alt="***" />  Learn Toki Pona <img alt="***" />

Toki Pona has a very simple sound system. There are only nine consonants and five vowels.

Every letter is always pronounced the same, regardless of what comes before or after it. Toki Pona is written all in lowercase, even in the beginning of a sentence. A capital letter is often used for proper names of people and places.

 

Consonants

There are nine consonants in Toki Pona. They are all pronounced as one would assume in English, except j, which represents a "y" sound.

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|p|t| |k|
| |s| | |
|m|n| | |
| |l| | |
|w| |j| |

p  as in *p*it, s*p*it, or *b*it  
t  as in *t*oo, s*t*ew, or *d*o  
k  as in *k*ill, s*k*ill, or *g*ill  
s  as in *s*ink or *z*inc  
m  as in *m*et  
n  as in *n*et  
l  as in *l*et  
w  as in *w*et  
j  as in *y*et  

Because there are so few sounds, there is a certain amount of flexibility on how each one can be pronounced. For example, p can also be pronounced as a "b" sound, and w can also be pronounced as a "v".

 

Vowels

There are five vowel sounds. They correspond loosely to the five vowels of Spanish, Esperanto, Japanese, Serbo-Croatian, or Hebrew. Click on any vowel to hear it pronounced.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|i| | | |u|
| |e| |o| |
| | |a| | |

i  as in p*ee*l
e  as in g*e*t
a  between the a of c*a*t and the a of f*a*ther
o  as in m*o*re
u  as in f*oo*d

 

Stress and Tone

Generally, the first syllable of a word is stressed.

There are no set rules for sentence intonation. It is not necessary to raise the tone in questions as we do in English, however there is also nothing wrong in doing so.

 

Syllable Structure

Syllables have a very simple structure: consonant + vowel + (optional **n**)

Examples: **kama, pona, kepeken, nasin, sinpin, Sonko, sewi**

In syllable-final position, **n** represents any nasal consonant sound, and assimilation occurs freely. For example, it is common to pronounce the word **tenpo** ("time") as **tempo**, or to pronounce **Sonko** _Chinese_ with a velar "ng" sound.

The first syllable of a word can begin without a consonant. /n/ cannot occur at the end of a syllable if the next one begins with **m** or **n**. The following syllables are impossible: _ji(n) wu(n) wo(n) ti(n)_.

Theoretically, these rules allow a total of 92 possible one-syllabe words, 6624 possible two-syllable words, and 476,928 possible three-syllables. In practice, however, the entire language has only 117 words. (Thanks to [Clayton](https://web.archive.org/web/20030710081930/http://www.argilo.net:80/index.html?lng=en) for the math.)
