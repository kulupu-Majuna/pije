## Vocabulary
### Things and Qualifiers
|           |                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| **kili**  | fruit, vegetable                 |
| **lili**  | small, little, young, a bit, few |
| **toki/** | language, act of talking, speech |
### Actions
|             |                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **jo e**    | to have, contain, possess      |
| **lukin e** | to see, look, watch, watch out |
| **moku e**  | to eat, drink                  |
###  Grammatical Particle 

|       |                            |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| **e** | introduces a direct object |
 

So far, we have learnt to create basic subject + verb sentences such as **jan li moku** _a person eats_.

In a sentence like "I have **water**", we have added a direct object, i.e. a word that receives the action of the verb _have_. In Toki Pona, the direct object is preceded by the word **e**.

|                  |              |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| **mi jo e telo** | I have water |

**Structure:** subject + **li** + verb + **e** + direct object

Remember: **li** is left out with the subjects **mi** _I_ and **sina** _you_.

## Sample Sentences

### With Direct Object (Transitive)
(Something or somebody _acts directly_ upon something else.)

|                                 |                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **mi lukin e moku**             | I see food.                 |
| **jan suli li jo e kili**       | The big person has fruit.   |
| **jan mute li jo e ma**         | Many people own land.       |
| **jan lili ike li moku e telo** | The bad child drinks water. |
| **mi lukin e suno**             | I look at the sun.          |
| **sina moku e kili**            | You eat veggies.            |

###  Without Direct Object (Intransitive)
(Something _does_ something on its own or _is a certain way_.)
|                            |                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **toki pona li toki pona** | Toki Pona is a good language. |
| **kili ni li lili**        | This fruit is small.          |
| **jan toki li ike**        | The talking person is evil.   |
| **toki sina li pona**      | Your language is good.        |
| **tenpo suno li lili**     | The day is short.             |

## Many

As we saw in Lesson One, there is no singular or plural in Toki Pona. **kili** means either _vegetable_ or _vegetables_.

If it is really necessary to show there is more than one, the word **mute** _many_ can be added: **kili mute** _several vegetables_.
 

## Compound Nouns

Be careful to **word order** when combining nouns:
|              |                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **toki jan** | languague of a person, a personal language |
| **jan toki** | person of language/speaking, speaker       |

|             |                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **kili ma** | vegetable of the earth (e.g. potato) |
| **ma kili** | land of vegetables, garden           |

## Practice

Translate the following into Toki Pona.

Remember the structure for sentences with a direct object:
subject + **li** + verb + **e** + direct object

- The child eats fruit. 
- I had a bad turnip. 
- You have a new friend. 
- Many people drank water. 
- This time is good. 
- The country's water is abundant. 
- I look at the big sun. 
- This language is little. 
- The adult is eating.
