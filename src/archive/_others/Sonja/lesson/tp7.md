## Being Somewhere

The verb **lon** is used to express a location. As with tawa ([Lesson Four](tp4)), it is used directly with the location, without adding **e** or any other word.

|                                 |                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sina lon ma                     | You are in the country.                                                     |
| waso mute li lon kon            | Several birds are in the air.                                               |
| mi lon tomo pi mama iki         | I am in the house of her parents                                            |
| kili laso li lon supa           | The green veggies are on the table.                                         |
| ilo pakala iki li lon tomo tawa | His tool for damaging is in the moving construction. His axe is in the car. |

**lon** can also be used after another verb.

|                                        |                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| waso li moku e telo mute lon ma laso   | The bird drinks much water in the green field. |
| meli li toki e ijo lon tomo suli       | The woman says something in the big building.  |
| jan lili li lukin e sina lon tomo telo | A kid was watching you in the bathroom.        |

When no location is specified, **lon** simply means _to be there, to exist, to be real._

|                         |                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| meli mi li lon          | My wife is here.                         |
| jan lili en laso li lon | Little, blue people exist. Smurfs exist. |
| mi lon ala              | I am not present.                        |

Note that **jo** _to have, contain_ can also express location.
|                            |                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tomo li jo e jan mute      | The house has many people. There are many people in the house.       |
| tomo lape li jo e ilo suno | The sleep-room has a light-device. There is a candle in the bedroom. |

 

## Pronouns

Because there is no real distinction between singular and plural in Toki Pona, these singular pronouns can also be used for plural. For example, **mi** can also mean _we_.
|      |                       |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| mi   | I                     |
| sina | you                   |
| iki  | he, she, it           |
| jan  | somebody, people, one |

If you really need to specify a plural, simply add **mute** (**mi mute** _we_) or add up individual pronouns (**sina en mi** _you and I_).

All plural pronouns require the word **li** before the verb. This verb-introducing particle is only dropped after **mi** and **sina** when these are used alone.
|             |                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| mi mute     | we                          |
| sina en mi  | you and I (inclusive we)    |
| mi en iki   | he/she and I (exclusive we) |
| sina mute   | you (plural)                |
| sina en iki | you and him/her             |
| ale         | they                        |

Note that **ale** is used more frequently for _they_ than **iki mute** or **iki**.
