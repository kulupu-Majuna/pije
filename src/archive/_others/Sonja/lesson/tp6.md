## Sex
The words **mije** _man, male_ and **meli** _woman, female_ can be used to mark the gender of a word.

|                   |                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **soweli meli**   | female animal      |
| **mije lili**     | small male, boy    |
| **jan pona meli** | a female friend    |
| **mije mi**       | my man, my husband |

## Adverbs
Just as adjectives come after a noun to modify it, an adverb can be added directly after a verb. Adverbs give information on _how or what way_ an action takes place or a state is.

|                                        |                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **mi toki _pona_ e toki**                | I speak the language _well_.                             |
| **iki li pali _ike_ e moku**             | He makes food _poorly_. He is a bad cook.                |
| **meli ni li pona _lukin_**              | This woman is good to _look at_. This girl is beautiful. |
| **iki li lukin _pona_ e ijo**            | She sees things _well_. She has good vision.             |
| **jan pona pi meli sina li tawa _mute_** | Your wife's friend walks _a lot_.                        |
| **sina pona _mute_**                     | You are _very_ good. You rock.                           |

## Negation

To form a negative, simply add the word **ala**. In most cases, **ala** would be used as an adverb after the verb.

|                                         |                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **mi pona ala**                         | I am not good.                     |
| **sina wile ala kama**                  | You don't want to come.            |
| **iki li pana ala e telo nasa tawa mi** | He doesn't give wine to me.        |
| **tenpo pimeja li suli ala**            | The night (dark-time) is not long. |

**ala** can also appear after a noun to modify it.

|                              |                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **mije li jo e ijo ala**     | The man has no-thing.                  |
| **jan ala li ken pali e ni** | No person can do it. Nobody can do it. |
