## Going Somewhere

The basic meaning of **tawa** is _to go to_.  
It acts as a preposition and never uses **e**. Simply put the destination right after the verb:

|                                       |                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **mi tawa tomo**                      | I go to the house                                                     |
| **sina tawa tomo telo**               | You go to the washroom (water room).                                  |
| **tomo tawa li ike**                  | The constructed space that moves (goes places) is bad. The car sucks. |
| **jan nasa mute li tawa tomo sin mi** | Many crazy people went to my new house.                               |

**tawa** also means _towards, to, for_:

|                                     |                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **jan li jo e kili sin tawa sina**  | Somebody has fresh veggies for   | you.
| **soweli suli li kama tawa mi**     | A big sheep came to me.          |
| **telo nasa li pona tawa mi**       | Beer (crazy liquid) is good to   |/for me. I like beer.
