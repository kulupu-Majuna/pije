## Basic Sentences

To express that somebody or something does something or is a certain way, we use a basic **subject + verb** construction.
In Toki Pona, the word **li** is used to mark off the subject from the verb.

**Structure**: subject + **li** + verb

With the subjects **mi** (_I_) and **sina** (_you_), **li** is omitted.

 

## Examples
|                 |                     |
|-----------------|---------------------|
|**jan li moku**  | the person eats     |
|**telo li pona** | water is good       |
|**suno li suli** | the sun is big      |
|**sina suli**    | you are big/tall    |
|**mi moku**      | I eat               |
|**sina pona**    | you are good        |
|**moku li pona** | food/eating is good |

Note that verbs in Toki Pona do not distinguish between past, present and future.
<table>
<td>

**sina moku**
<td> 

you eat  
you ate  
you will eat
</table>

There are also no words for _the_ and _a_:
<table>
<td>

**telo li pona**
<td>

the water is good  
water is good
</table>

There is no distinction between singular and plural. For example, **jan** means both _person_ and _people_.

Many words in Toki Pona cover a broad range of meanings. So, depending on context, many interpretations are possible:
<table>
<td>

**suno li suli**
<td>

the sun is big  
the day is long  
the sun is important  
</table>
<table>
<td>

**moku li pona**
<td>

the food was good  
eating rocks
</table>

Translate the following into Toki Pona.

- Somebody is important.
