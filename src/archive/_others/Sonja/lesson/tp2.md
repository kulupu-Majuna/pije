## Combining Nouns

In the past lesson, we learnt a few simple nouns. Given the very limited vocabulary of Toki Pona, the language relies a lot on combining nouns together to compose more advanced meanings.

One of way of doing this is by adding a second noun or adjective after the first one:

|          |                     |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| jan      | person              |
| jan pona | good person, friend |
| jan ike  | bad person, jerk    |
| jan ni   | this person         |

|            |                |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| tenpo      | time           |
| tenpo pona | good time, fun |
| tenpo suno | sun time, day  |
| tenpo mute | many times     |
| tenpo suli | a long time    |

|         |             |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ma      | country     |
| ma suli | big country |

The second word behaves like an adjective and modifies the meaning of the head noun, adding more precision. The main noun always comes first.

## Cumulative Qualifiers

In this way, qualifiers can be added after a noun. These are _cumulative_. That is, if we add a third word, it will modify the sum meaning of all the previous ones, rather than just the word that directly precedes it.


|             |                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| jan         | person                                       |
| jan suli    | big/tall/important person, adult, VIP, giant |
| jan suli ni | this big person, this adult                  |

|                 |                 |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| tenpo           | time            |
| tenpo suno      | sun time, day   |
| tenpo suno ni   | this day, today |
| tenpo suno pona | a good day      |

We analyse the meanings in order. In the first example, **suli** _big_ qualifies **jan** _person_, giving **jan suli** _adult_. Then, **ni** _this_ adds to **jan suli** _adult_ to create **jan suli ni** _this adult_.

## Possessives

Possessive forms like _my_, _your_ and _Matthew's_ are also treated as qualifiers. Simply place the possessive word after the main noun.

|          |                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| moku mi  | my food                            |
| ma sina  | your land                          |
| telo jan | a person's water, somebody's water |
| telo ma  | the country's water                |

Note that words never change forms. Thus, **mi** can mean either _I_, _me_, or _my_. It is the word's position that tells us its meaning and function.

In another example, **telo** _water, liquid_ can mean _watery, wet, humid_ if used after another noun.

|            |                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| ma telo    | watery country, wet earth, mud    |
| tenpo telo | water time, humid or rainy season |

 

## More Examples

|                      |                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| tenpo suno li pona   | The day is good.                     |
| jan suli li moku     | The big person (or adult) is eating. |
| ma ni li suli mute   | This country is very big.            |
| ma mute li pona      | Many countries are good.             |
| mi jan               | I am human.                          |
| sina jan pona        | You are a good person (friend).      |
| telo sina li ike     | Your water is bad.                   |
| jan suli ike li kama | The evil giant came.                 |
