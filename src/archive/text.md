### [Logs from the Chat Room](/text/chat)
Here is a small collection of logs made in the Toki Pona chat room. Hopefully you can learn something from them.

## In Toki Pona

### [nasin pona](/_others/nikita/intro)
This is a collection of short prose by Nikita, one of the three fluent Toki Pona speakers. These texts are short, but they are perfect examples of the ideology behind Toki Pona, not to mention how inspiring they are.

### [Zompist phrasebook](/text/zompist)
If you've ever read the handy-dandy Zompist phrasebook, you should be happy to know that now you can use all of those phrases in Toki Pona as well. (If you have never heard of the Zompist phrasebook, you can check out the original here.)

### [Survivalist's Phrasebook](/text/survive)
If Toki Pona were spoken in a third world, anti-American country undergoing a violent revolution, you'd want to make sure to bring this phrasebook along.

### [Script for Monty Python and the Holy Grail](/text/mphg)
Yes, it's the script for the entire movie, and it took a long time. But now you can enjoy all your favorite scenes like the one with the killer bunny rabbit or the anarcho-syndicalist peasant or the lengthy discourses on swallows!

### [William Wallace's Speech in Braveheart](/text/braveheart)
If you've seen Braveheart, you might recollect this rousing speech. As the English are marching onto the battlefield, the much smaller Scottish rebel army becomes frightened and wants to run away into the hills. Then, Wallace arrives and gives this speech, which inspires the Scottish and leads them to victory.

### [Ring poem from The Lord of the Rings](/text/ring)
The popular (well, sorta popular) poem about Sauron's Ring. Woohoo.

### [Toki Pona Quickies](/text/quickies)
If you've ever seen the funny Book-A-Minute site online, this follows the same idea but in Toki Pona.

### [Jabberwocky](/text/jabberwock)
Now you can read a Toki Pona translation of the poem that Lewis Carroll probably wrote during a serious high.

### [My First Poem in Toki Pona](/text/lape)
I'm quite proud of this poem! Rather than simply writing the poem, I also tried to use different colors and arrangements of the words and letters to convey meanings.

### [kili lili](/text/kili)
A short, rhyming poem about a piece of fruit.

### [sina suno mi](/text/sun)
A translation of the children's song You are my Sunshine.

### [soweli Luta](/text/rudolph)
This is an adaptation of the Christmas song Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

### [meli pona](/text/meli)
A love poem from a man to his meli.

### [Brief History of Everything](/text/hista)
This briefly explains, well, everything! It starts with the Big Bang and discusses the major topics in history up until today.

### [toki pi nasin sewi](/text/tokisewi)
