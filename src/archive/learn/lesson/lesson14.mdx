## Vocabulary  

**akesi** - reptile, amphibian  
**kala** - fish or an animal that live in water         
**kasi** - plant  

Don't forget that **pipi** is any type of bug.

**moli** - death; to die, to kill  
**soweli** - mammal  
**waso** - bird  



## Ambiguity of Names of Living Things  
I'm sure that by lesson fourteen, you've seen time and time again that Toki Pona's vocabulary is fairly vague and inspecific. Well, the names for plants and animals are no different. I'm going to give you a quick run-through of the different groups and mention a few things about each one along the way. So let's get started.

### akesi
_akesi_ covers all of the reptiles and amphibians. Here is a small sample of animals that would be called _akesi_:

![](/images/lesson14a.jpg)

Many monsters would also fall under _akesi_. People generally associate monsters as being scary and slimy with weird skin, and there are many _akesi_ that are like that. Dinosaurs also would be _akesi_.

So, you see, you can't be very specific when it comes to these animal names. But really, that's part of the unique beauty of Toki Pona. How many other languages do you know in which one word can mean gecko, lizard, alligator, snake, iguana, dinosaur, turtle, and a ton of other similar animals?

However, you can still use adjectives and _pi_ phrases to try to get across some meaning. For example, here's a good way to talk about venomous snakes: _akesi pi telo moli_ ("reptile/amphibian of deadly liquid"). This term could apply to venomous snakes or also those poisonous frogs that can kill a human just by jumping on the person. 

### kala
_kala_ is used to talk about fish and other animals that live in water. Here are a few examples:

![](/images/lesson14b.jpg)

Also, _kala_ can be used as an adjective. This is especially useful when you want to talk about mermaids. _jan kala_ = mermaid. 

### kasi
_kasi_ is used to talk about **all** plants and plant-like things. _kasi_ goes from the tallest tree down to small fungi. It's also used to mean "leaf<Change till={1}>".</Change><Change from={1}>."</Change> Here are some examples of _kasi_:

![](/images/lesson14c.jpg)

Generally, when talking about flowers, you can say _kasi kule_, because flowers are colorful, of course. And this helps distinguish that you mean a flower and not a typical plant.

When talking about trees, big shrubs, etc., it's best to say _kasi suli_. For small little weeds and such, use _kasi lili_. We use _lipu kasi_ to mean "leaf<Change till={1}>",</Change><Change from={1}>,"</Change> and _kasi anpa_ for "grass<Change till={1}>".</Change><Change from={1}>."</Change>

There's a particular plant (ahem) which is illegal in most nations but which greatly inspired Toki Pona and which is used for recreation and/or meditation by some people. If it's used for recreation, it's referred to as _kasi nasa_. When used for meditation, it's called _kasi sona_.

You can also say _ma kasi_ ("land (of) plants") to mean forest or jungle. 

### pipi
_pipi_ is used for all types of bugs, including spiders, ants, roaches, and butterflies. Here are two examples of _pipi_:

![](/images/lesson14d.jpg)

### soweli
_soweli_ is basically for all types of mammals. Here are a few _soweli_:

![](/images/lesson14e.jpg)

If you're eating meat that comes from a _soweli_ (such as beef or pork), it is still called _soweli_. There is no separate word for the meat; it's all the same:  
> soweli ni li pona moku. -- This cow is good to eat.  

We use _pona moku_ to mean "tasty" or "delicious<Change till={1}>",</Change><Change from={1}>,"</Change> by the way.

### waso
_waso_ includes all birds and flying animals. Here are a few:

![](/images/lesson14f.jpg)

Like _soweli_, if you're eating meat that comes from a bird, you still call it _waso_. For example:  
> mi wile moku e waso. -- I want to eat chicken.


## _moli_  
There's nothing hard about this word, I just wanted to show a few examples to make sure you understand it. It can be used to say that something is dead:  
> pipi li moli. -- The bug is dead.  

If you want to say that something is dying but is not yet dead, use _kama moli_. _kama_ gives _moli_ a progressive-like effect, as we've seen in the phrases _kama jo_ (to get) and _kama sona_ (to learn).  
> soweli li kama moli. -- The cheetah is dying.  

And you also use _moli_ to talk about one thing killing another:  
> jan li moli e waso. -- The person killed the bird.


## Practice  
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.  

- I want a puppy.   <Spoiler>mi wile e soweli lili.</Spoiler>  
- Ahh! The dinosaur wants to eat me!   <Spoiler>a! akesi li wile moku e mi!</Spoiler>  
- The mosquito bit me.   <Spoiler>pipi li moku e mi. You can also say "moku lili" ("eat a little") instead of just "moku". It usually means "nibble" or "suck", but it can work in this situation too.</Spoiler>  
- Cows say moo.   <Spoiler>soweli li toki e mu.</Spoiler>  
- Birds fly in air.   <Spoiler>waso li tawa lon kon.</Spoiler>
  - Think: "Birds go in air."  
- Let's eat fish.   <Spoiler>mi mute o moku e kala.</Spoiler>  
- Flowers are pretty.   <Spoiler>kasi kule li pona lukin.</Spoiler>
  - Think: "Colorful plants are good to see."  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  

- mama ona li kepeken e kasi nasa.   <Spoiler>His mother used pot.</Spoiler>  
- akesi li pana e telo moli.   <Spoiler>The snake emitted venom ("deadly fluid").</Spoiler>  
- pipi li moku e kasi.   <Spoiler>Bugs eat plants.</Spoiler>  
- soweli mi li kama moli.   <Spoiler>My dog is dying.</Spoiler>  
- jan Pawe o, mi wile ala moli.   <Spoiler>Forrest, I don't want to die.</Spoiler>  
- I like plants.   <Spoiler>kasi li pona tawa mi.</Spoiler>  
- mi lon ma kasi.   <Spoiler>I'm in the forest.</Spoiler>
