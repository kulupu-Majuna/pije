## Vocabulary
**kama** - to come, to happen, to cause             
**kepeken** - to use; with, using  
**kiwen** - stone, rock; hard like a rock  
**kon** - air, atmosphere, spirit, wind  
**lon** - to be in/at/on, to exist; in, at, on  
**pana** - to give, to send, to release, to emit  
**poki** - container, bowl, glass, cup, box, etc.  
**toki** - language; to talk, to speak  
**tawa** - to go to, to move; to, for  

 

## lon
_lon_, like _tawa_ and _kepeken_, can be used as both a verb and a preposition. Study these examples:
> mi lon tomo. -- I'm in the house.
> mi moku lon tomo. -- I eat in the house.

In the first example, _lon_ is used as the verb of the sentence; in the second, it is used as a preposition. Neat, huh? Here are some more examples:  
> suno li lon sewi. -- The sun is in the sky.  
> mi telo e mi lon tomo telo. -- I bathe myself in the restroom.  
>> Remember from lesson 5 that _tomo telo_ means restroom, bathroom, etc.  
>
> kili li lon poki. -- The fruit is in the basket.

### Using _lon_ with _wile_
Because _lon_ can be used as either a preposition or a verb, the meaning of the sentence can be a bit confusing when used with _wile_. For example:
> mi wile lon tomo. -- I want to be at home. **OR** I want in a house.

The Toki Pona sentence has two possible translations. The first translation states that the speaker wishes he were at home. The second translation states that the speaker wants to do something (although he doesn't actually state what he wants to do) in a house. It's best to split this sentence up to avoid confusion:
> mi wile e ni: mi lon tomo. -- I want this: I'm at home.

Toki Pona often uses this _e ni:_ trick to get by without having _that_ as used in sentences such as "You told me **that** you are eating." This sentence would be translated as "sina toki e ni tawa mi: sina moku." This feature is common in Toki Pona and you'll see it more as you proceed through these lessons.


### Using _lon_ as an action verb
What you are about to learn is a minor detail and is rarely used in Toki Pona. It's also going to use some vocabulary that we haven't learned yet. Unless you're just highly interested, you should probably skip this section and come back later if you want to, because this feature is not very important at all.

... So you're still here? Good! Firstly, we need to cover two vocabulary words: lape (sleep), pini (stop, end). These words will be covered in later lessons, so you don't have to memorize them now if you do not wish to, but they are necessary for what you are about to learn. Now, with this new vocabulary, you can talk about waking someone up:
> mi pini e lape sina. -- I ended your sleep. I woke you up.

That is plain enough. However, you can also express this using lon:
> mi lon e sina. -- I made you aware of reality. I forced you to be to present and alert.

Note, however, that you could not say, "sina lon e mi" ("You woke me up"). The person who was sleeping was in his own private existance of sleep. When he woke up, he would not feel that he had brought into reality because, to him, sleep was the reality. He was simply moved from one existance to another one. "mi lon e sina" only works because, to the waker, it seems as if the sleeper is not present in the waker's reality; the sleeper seems absent, and so waking him up brings him back to reality. Make sense?

If you didn't quite understand that, don't worry. It's a very minor diversion included for anyone who happens to be interested. For most situations, it'd be best to use the _pini e lape_ phrase.

## _kepeken_
This one isn't too difficult. It's actually easier than _lon_ because you use _e_ after it like you've been doing other verbs.
> mi kepeken e ilo. - I'm using tools.  
> sina wile kepeken e ilo. - You have to use tools.  
> mi kepeken e poki ni. - I'm using that cup.

And _kepeken_ can also be used as a preposition.
> mi moku kepeken ilo moku. - I eat using a fork/spoon/any type of eating utensil.  
> mi lukin kepeken ilo suno. - I look using a flashlight. (ilo suno = a tool of light, hence flashlight)

This shouldn't seem too difficult.

## tawa
### Using tawa as a verb
Hopefully you understood _lon_ well, because _tawa_ is similar to it. Like _lon_, _tawa_ doesn't have an ) after it.
> mi tawa tomo mi. -- I'm going to my house.  
> ona mute li tawa utala - They're going to the war.  
> sina wile tawa telo suli. -- You want to go to the ocean.  
> ona li tawa sewi kiwen. -- She's going up the rock.
>> Note that sewi as used in this sentence is a noun. A more literal
>> translation of that sentence is "She's going to the top (of) the rock."

The reason that _lon_ and _tawa_ don't have an _e_ after them is that there is no object. For example, in the sentence "I'm going to my house," the speaker simply went home. He did not **do** anything to his house, he just went to it. If he had burned the house down or had tried to **do** something to it or affect it in some way, then _e_ would come after the verb. Otherwise, no _e_.

### Using _tawa_ to mean "to"
As I said a moment ago, _tawa_ is often used as a preposition.
> mi toki tawa sina. - I talk to you.  
> ona li lawa e jan tawa ma pona. - He led people to the good land.  
> ona li kama tawa ma mi. - He's coming to my country.  

This is also a good time to talk about how to say that you like certain things. In Toki Pona, to say that you like something, we have a pattern, and the pattern uses _tawa_ as a preposition:
> _ni li pona tawa mi._ - That is good to me. (or, in other words, "I like that.")

And to say that you don't like something, replace pona with ike.
> _ni li ike tawa mi_ - That is bad to me. I don't like that.

Here are some examples:
> kili li pona tawa mi. - I like fruit.
> toki li pona tawa mi. - I like talking. or I like languages.
> tomo li ike tawa mi. - I don't like buildings.
> telo suli li ike tawa mi. - I don't like the ocean.

Keep in mind that _e_ can only come after the verb of the sentence. Toki Pona does not use clauses. So for example, if you wanted to say "I like watching the countryside," you could **NOT** say something like this: _lukin e ma li pona tawa mi._ It's best to split this into two sentences:
> mi lukin e ma. ni li pona tawa mi. - I'm watching the countryside. This is good to me.

Of course, you could choose to say this same sentence using other techniques we learned in chapter five:
> ma li pona lukin. - The countryside is good visually. The countryside is good to look at.

### Using _tawa_ to mean "for"
Okay, so _tawa_ essentially means _to go to_ or simply _to_, right? Not exactly. It can also mean _for_, as in this sentence:
> mi pona e tomo tawa jan pakala. -- I fixed the house for the disabled man.

Unfortunately, the trick of letting _tawa_ mean both to and for isn't without its drawbacks. Keep reading to see why.

### Using _tawa_ as an adjective
You know how some words in Toki Pona can be used as nouns, verbs, or adjectives, depending on context? Well, _tawa_ is the same way. _tawa_ is used as an adjective to make the phrase we use for _car_:

> _tomo tawa_ - car <small>(a more literal translation is "moving construction")</small>  
> _tomo tawa telo_ - boat, ship  
> _tomo tawa kon_ - airplane, helicopter

### Ambiguity of _tawa_
I want you to think about the following sentence for a few moments before continuing on. See if you can think of different meanings that it might have.
> mi pana e tomo tawa sina.

Okay. If _tawa_ is used as an adjective, then this sentence says "I gave your car." If it is used as a preposition, though, it could mean, "I gave the house to you." So, how do you tell the difference? You don't! (Insert evil, mocking laugh here.) This is one of those problems inherent in Toki Pona that there is no way to avoid.

### _tawa_ as an action verb
We have only one more thing to learn about _tawa_ (Yay!). Do you remember how I said _tawa_ doesn't have an _e_ after it because nothing is being done to an object? Well, that's true, but tawa can have objects, like this:
> mi tawa e kiwen. -- I'm moving the rock.  
> ona li tawa e len mi. -- She moved my clothes.

_tawa_ can be used as an action verb in these situations because there is an object. Something has done an action on something else; that was not the case with _tawa_ in other example sentences.

 

## kama
We've already briefly touched on this word, but it is quite common, and so we need to look at it a little more closely.

First, it's used with _tawa_, like this:
> ona li kama tawa tomo mi. -- He came to my house.

It can also be used as an action verb. It means "to cause" or "to bring about":
> mi kama e pakala. -- I caused an accident.  
> sina kama e ni: mi wile moku. -- You caused this: I want to eat. You made me hungry.
>> Note that you couldn't have said _sina kama e mi wile moku_. Toki Pona
>> does not have clauses; pieces of sentences cannot be shoved together
>> like that. If you're in doubt, it's usually wise simply to split a sentence
>> into two.

It can also be used with infinitives to make a progressive-like effect. One of the most common infinitives that it is used with is _jo_, so we'll just cover it for now. When you say _kama jo_, it means _get_:
> mi kama jo e telo. -- I came to have the water. I got the water.

Neat, huh? _kama_ is a very flexible word.

 

## Practice
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.
- I fixed the flashlight using a small tool. <Spoiler>mi pona e ilo suno kepeken ilo lili.</Spoiler>  
- I like Toki Pona. <Spoiler>toki pona li pona tawa mi.</Spoiler>  
- We gave them food. <Spoiler>mi mute li pana e moku tawa ona mute.</Spoiler> 
   - If you got that one wrong, think of the sentence like
     this: "We gave food to them." It means the same thing. 
- This is for my friend. <Spoiler>ni li tawa jan pona mi.</Spoiler>  
- The tools are in the container. <Spoiler>ilo li lon poki.</Spoiler>  
- That bottle is in the dirt. <Spoiler>poki ni li lon jaki.</Spoiler>  
- I want to go to his house using my car. <Spoiler>mi wile tawa tomo ona kepeken tomo tawa mi.</Spoiler>  
- They are arguing. <Spoiler>ona mute li  utala toki.</Spoiler>  
   - Hint: Remember what you learned about adverbs in lesson 5.

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:
- sina wile kama tawa tomo toki. <Spoiler>You should come to the chat room.</Spoiler>  
- jan li toki kepeken toki pona lon tomo toki. <Spoiler>People talk in/using Toki Pona in the chat room.</Spoiler>  
- mi tawa tomo toki. ona li pona tawa mi. <Spoiler>I go the chat room. It is good for me.  OR I   like to go to the chat room.</Spoiler>
- sina kama jo e jan pona lon ni. <Spoiler>You will get friends there.</Spoiler>  
  - _lon ni_ means either "here" or "there". Can you figure out what it literally means?
