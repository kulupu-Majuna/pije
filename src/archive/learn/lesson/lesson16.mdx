## Vocabulary
**luka** - five  
**nanpa** - number  
**tu** - two; to divide  
**wan** - one; to unite  
**weka** - away; to remove, to eliminate  

Yes, I know that you've learned _luka_ as meaning hand or arm. But it also means five. _luka_ is used in this way because there are *five* fingers on your *hand*. 

##  Use Numbers Sparingly!
Okay, before I even begin this lesson, I want to say something: The method that you're about to learn for making higher numbers should be avoided as much as possible. While it is possible to say numbers like 23 in Toki Pona, by **no** means should you specify these particular numbers unless it is crucial that you do so.

If you try to use this method all the time for every number you want to talk about, a big, bad _akesi_ will come and nibble your little toe! 

## Cardinal Numbers
Okay, now as you've probably already noticed, there are only three number words in Toki Pona: _wan_ 1, _tu_ 2, and _luka_ 5.

When we need to make higher numbers, we combine these numbers together. Essentially, you just string _wan_, _tu_, and _luka_ together to add up to the number you want. For example, here's how you add _tu_ and _wan_ together to make 3:
> tu wan = 2 + 1 = 3

Neat, huh? Here are some more examples:
> tu tu = 2 + 2 = 4
> luka wan = 5 + 1 = 6
> luka luka = 5 + 5 = 10
> luka luka tu = 5 + 5 + 2 = 12

These numbers are added onto nouns just like adjectives:
> jan luka tu = 7 people
> jan lili tu wan = 3 children

As you can see, it can get very confusing if you want to talk about numbers higher than 14 or so. For example, 25 would be _luka luka luka luka luka_. Or even worse, think about the horrors of translating the entire song of *100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall*. However, Toki Pona is simply not intended for such high numbers. It is a simple language. If you can't cope with not being able to talk about the number 523 in a language, then Toki Pona is not for you. Maybe you'd be happier with Latin. --- Anyway, the reason that I mention this is because I once saw someone on the Toki Pona message board who used an awful, sickening perversion of Toki Pona in order to try to write high numbers quickly. He used _pi_ essentially as a sign to multiply the numbers. For example, here is how he wrote 25:
> luka pi luka

Keep in mind that that is **NOT** correct. Frankly, I think this method is revolting and completely against the reason that Toki Pona was created in the first place. 

## Use _mute_. Conserve the Numbers.
Okay, so it's a bad idea to use the numbers when you don't absolutely need them. So, instead, we use _mute_ for any number higher than two:
> jan mute li kama. -- Many people came.

Of course, this is still pretty vague. _mute_ in the above sentence could mean 3 or it could mean 3 000. Fortunately, _mute_ is just an adjective, and so we can attach other adjectives after it. Here's what you might say if there were lots and lots of people:
> jan mute mute mute li kama! -- Many, many, many people are coming!

More than likely, that sentence is saying that at least a thousand people are coming. ---- Now suppose that you had more than two people but still not very many. Let's say that the number is around 4 or 5. Here's how you'd say that:
> jan mute lili li kama. -- A small amount (of) people are coming.

Once again, these descriptions are still relative and would change depending on what you're talking about. Just try to use good judgment, and remember that Toki Pona is not about being exact. 

## Ordinal Numbers
If you understood how the cardinal numbers work, the ordinal numbers only require one more step. Here's how you'd translate "4th person":
> jan pi nanpa tu tu -- person of number 4; 4th person

Like I said, if you understood the cardinal numbers, it's easy because you just stick _pi nanpa_ in between the noun and the number. Here are a few more examples, if you think you need to look at them:
> ni li jan lili ona pi nanpa tu. -- This is her second child.
> meli mi pi nanpa wan li nasa. -- My first girlfriend was crazy. 

##  Other Uses of _wan_ and _tu_
_wan_ can be used as a verb. It means _to unite_.
> mi en meli mi li wan. -- I and my girlfriend united. My girlfriend and I got married.

_tu_ used as a verb means _to split_ or _to divide_.
> o tu e palisa ni. -- Split this stick. Break it into two pieces. 

##  Miscellaneous
Today's word is _weka_. As a verb, it just means _to get rid of_, _to remove_, etc.
> o weka e len sina. -- Remove your clothes.
> o weka e jan lili tan ni. ona li wile ala kute e ni. -- Remove the kid from here. He shouldn't hear this.

_weka_ is also used very often as an adjective and an adverb.
   mi weka. -- I was away.
   mi wile tawa weka. -- I want to go away. I want to leave.

It can also be used to mean the equivalent of _far_ or _distant_.
   tomo mi li weka tan ni. -- My house is away from here.
   ma Elopa li weka tan ma Mewika. -- Europe is away from the USA.

And add _ala_ to mean that it's somewhere closeby:
   ma Mewika li weka ala tan ma Kupa. -- The USA is not away from Cuba. 


### Practice
Try changing these sentences from English into Toki Pona.
- I saw three birds.   <Spoiler>mi lukin e waso tu wan.</Spoiler>
- Many people are coming.   <Spoiler>jan mute li kama.</Spoiler>
- The first person is here.   <Spoiler>jan pi nanpa wan li lon.</Spoiler>
- I own two cars.   <Spoiler>mi jo e tomo tawa tu.</Spoiler>
- Some (but not a lot) of people are coming.   <Spoiler>jan mute lili li kama.</Spoiler>
- Unite!   <Spoiler>o wan!</Spoiler>

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:
- mi weka e ijo tu ni.   <Spoiler>I got rid of those two things.</Spoiler>
- o tu.   <Spoiler>Break up. Split apart.</Spoiler>
- mi lukin e soweli luka.   <Spoiler>I saw five mammals.</Spoiler>
- mi weka.   <Spoiler>I was away.</Spoiler>
