You've already learned _toki_ and _pona_, but you're being reintroduced to them because they're going to be used differently in this lesson.

## Vocabulary  

**a** - ahh, ha!, umm, hmm, ooh, etc.  
**awen** - to wait, to pause, to stay; remaining        
**mama** - parent  
**mije** - man, husband, boyfriend, male  
**meli** - woman, wife, girlfriend, female  
**mu** - woof, meow, moo, any animal sound  
**nimi** - name, word  
**o** - used for vocative and imperative  
**pona** - yay!, cool, good  
**toki** - language; hey!  

## Gender  
Toki Pona doesn't have any grammatical gender like in most Western languages. (Yay!) However, some words in Toki Pona (such as _mama_) don't tell you which gender a person is, and so we use _mije_ and _meli_ to distinguish. For example:  
> mama -- a parent in general; doesn't tell whether it's mother or father  
>> mama meli -- mother  
>> mama mije -- father  

It's as simple as that. Keep in mind, though, that in Toki Pona it's usually best not to specify whether the person you're talking about is male or female unless there's a special reason for doing so. Specifying male or female is often unnecessary, so why bother?

## Unofficial words  
Okay, this might seem a little odd at first, but it's really quite a neat feature in Toki Pona. Take a moment to look over the Toki Pona dictionary. You'll see lots of words you already know: _pona_, _jaki_, _suno_, and _utala_. However, as you might have noticed, there are no words for the names of nations; there are also aren't any words for religions or even other languages. The reason that these words aren't in the dictionary is because they are "unofficial". Click the link to check out the [Toki Pona Dictionary](/_others/sonja/dict). Any words that are not in that dictionary are considered to be unofficial.

Before using an unofficial word, we often adapt the word to fit into Toki Pona's phonetic rules. So, for example, America becomes _Mewika_, Canada becomes _Kanata_, and so on. You can find some more unofficial words on tokipona.org.

Now the thing about these unofficial words is that they can never be used by themselves. They are always treated like adjectives, and so they have to be used with a noun. For example, suppose you wanted to say "Canada is good". Because _Kanata_ is an unofficial word, it has to be used as an adjective. And because we're talking about the **nation** of Canada, we'll use the word _ma_ (the Toki Pona word for **nation** or **country**) with _Kanata_:  
> ma Kanata li pona.

See? The unofficial words are treated just like all other adjectives that you've been using in Toki Pona so far. A more literal translation of _ma Kanata_ is _Canadian nation_. Here are some more sentences using the names of countries:  
> ma Isale li ike. -- Israel is evil.  
> ma Italija li pona lukin. -- Italy is beautiful.  
>> Remember from lesson five that _pona lukin_ means _pretty_, _attractive_, etc. It literally means "good visually".)  
>
> mi wile tawa ma Tosi. -- I want to go to Germany.


Do you remember from lesson five that _ma tomo_ means _city_? When talking about the names of cities, we say _ma tomo_ rather than just _ma_, and then add on the name of the city like we did for the countries above:  
> ma tomo Lantan li suli. -- London is big.  

Once again, the unofficial word (Lantan) is used as an adjective. Here are a few more examples of names of cities:  
> ma tomo Pelin -- Berlin  
> ma tomo Alenta -- Atlanta  
> ma tomo Loma -- Rome


So if we're talking about a country we use _ma_, and if it's a city we use _ma tomo_. If you want to talk about a language, you simply use _toki_ and then attach the unofficial word onto it. The unofficial word does not change:  
> toki Inli li pona. -- The English language is good.  
> ma Inli li pona. -- England is good.  

_Inli_ didn't change, even though in English the word does change. Neat, huh? Here are some more languages:  
> toki Kanse -- French language  
> toki Epelanto -- Esperanto


If you want to talk about a person who is from a certain place, you just say _jan_ and then attach the unofficial word at the end, like this:  
> jan Kanata -- Canadian person  
> jan Mesiko -- Mexican person  

Of course, you can use other nouns to describe certain people, too. For example, you can use the _mije_ and _meli_ that you learned a few minutes ago. Unless you have a specific reason for saying whether the person is male or female, though, it's best just to use _jan_. At any rate, here are some examples:  
> meli Italija -- Italian woman  
> mije Epanja -- Spanish man


Now suppose you want to talk about someone using their name. For example, what if you want to say "Lisa is cool"? Well, it's quite simple. To say a person's name in Toki Pona, you just say _jan_ and then the person's name:  
> jan Lisa li pona.  

That's not so bad, now is it? _jan_ + name. Simple! Like for the names of countries, we often adapt a person's name to fit into Toki Pona's phonetic rules. Here are some sentences using names that have been tokiponized:  
> jan Pentan li pana e sona tawa mi. -- Brandon teaches to me.  
>> _pana e sona_ literally means _to give knowledge_. It's used to mean _to teach_.  
>
> jan Mewi li toki tawa mi. -- Mary's talking to me.  
> jan Nesan li musi. -- Nathan is funny.  
> jan Eta li jan unpa. -- Heather is a whore.


If you're interested in having your own Toki Pona name, come by the Toki Pona chat room or email me at bknight009@yahoo.com . Anyway, there are two ways to tell people who you are:  
> mi jan Pepe. -- I am Pepe.  
> nimi mi li Pepe. -- My name is Pepe.  

Keep in mind that no one is going to pressure you to adopt a tokiponized name; it's just for fun. We won't tar and feather you if you like your name the way it is. :)

## Addressing People, Commands, Interjections

### Addressing People
Sometimes you need to get a person's attention before you can talk to him, like when you say something such as "Ken, a bug is on your shirt." Here's how you'd say that sentence:  
> jan Ken o, pipi li lon len sina.  

When you want to address someone like that before saying the rest of the sentence, you just follow this same pattern: **_jan_ (name) _o_ (rest of sentence)**. Here are some more examples:  
> jan Keli o, sina pona lukin. -- Kelly, you are pretty.  
> jan Mawen o, sina wile ala wile moku? -- Marvin, are you hungry?  
> jan Tepani o, sina ike tawa mi. -- Steffany, I don't like you.  

Although it's not essential, you should try to remember to put the comma after the _o_. You'll see why in a minute when you learn about making commands.

Toki Pona also has a neat little word _a_ which can be used whenever you're addressing people. Observe:  
> jan Epi o a! -- Oh Abbie!  

However, this _a_ is used sparingly. It's only used when the person makes you feel really emotional. For example, you might use the _a_ when you haven't seen the person for a very long time or when having sex. -- Also, did you see how I didn't actually write a sentence after saying "jan Epi o a!"? That's quite common, especially when you address the person with _a_. You don't have to say a sentence after addressing someone; it's optional.

### Commands
Commands are quite simple in Toki Pona. You simply say _o_ and then whatever you want the person to do, like this:  
> o pali! -- Work!  
> o awen. -- Wait.  
> o lukin e ni. -- Watch this.  
> o tawa ma tomo poka jan pona sina. -- Go to the city with your friend.  

That's not so bad. We've learned how to address people and how to make commands; now let's put these two concepts together. Suppose you want to address someone **and** tell them to do something. Here's how:  
> John, go to your house. ----&gt;  
> jan San o (John,) + o tawa tomo sina (Go to your house.) ----&gt;  
> jan San o tawa tomo sina.  

Notice how one of the _o_'s got dropped, as did the comma. Here are some more examples:  
> jan Ta o toki ala tawa mi. -- Todd, don't talk to me.  
> jan Sesi o moku e kili ni. -- Jessie, eat this fruit.  

This structure can also be used to make sentences like "Let's go":  
> mi mute o tawa. -- Let's go.  
>> Don't forget from lesson 5 that _mi mute_ is used to mean "we".  
>
> mi mute o musi. -- Let's have fun.


### Interjections
I'm going to split the interjections into two groups so that they're easier to explain. The first group is very straight-forward:  
> _toki_ is used to mean hello.  
>> toki! -- Hello!, Hi!, etc.  
>
> jan Lisa o, toki. -- Hello, Lisa.  
> _pona_ is what you say when something good happens.  
>> pona! -- Yay! Good! Hoorah!  
>
> _ike_ is what you say when something bad happens.  
>> ike! -- Oh no!, Uh oh!, Alas!, etc.  
>
> _pakala_ essentially covers all the curse words.  
>> pakala! -- f-ck! d-mn!  
>
> _mu_ is for sounds made by animals.  
>> mu. -- Meow. Woof. Grrr. Moo.  
>
> _a_ is a word that expresses emotion or laughter.  
>> a. -- Ooh, ahh, unh, oh, etc.  
>
> a a a! -- Hahaha! (laughter)  

The second group of interjections are kinda like salutations, I guess you could say. Anyway, here they are:  
> suno pona!  -- Good sun! Good day!  
> lape pona!  -- Sleep well! Have a good night!  
> moku pona!  -- Good food! Enjoy your meal!  
> mi tawa  -- I'm going. Bye!  
> tawa pona!  -- (in reply) Go well! Good bye!  
> kama pona!  -- Come well! Welcome!  
> musi pona!  -- Good fun! Have fun!  


## Practice  
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.  

- Susan is crazy.   <Spoiler>jan Susan li nasa.</Spoiler>  
- Go!   <Spoiler>o tawa!</Spoiler>  
- Mama, wait.   <Spoiler>mama meli o awen.</Spoiler>  
- I come from Europe. [Europe = Elopa]   <Spoiler>mi kama tan ma Elopa.</Spoiler>  
- Hahaha! That's funny.   <Spoiler>a a a! ni li musi.</Spoiler>  
- My name is Ken.   <Spoiler>nimi mi li Ken.</Spoiler>  
- Hello, Lisa.   <Spoiler>jan Lisa o, toki.</Spoiler>  
- &amp;@#$! [like in comics when people get angry]   <Spoiler>pakala!</Spoiler>  
- I want to go to Australia. [Australia = _Oselija_].   <Spoiler>mi wile tawa ma Oselija.</Spoiler>  
- Bye! (spoken by the person who's leaving).   <Spoiler>mi tawa!</Spoiler>  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  

- mu.   <Spoiler>meow, woof, moo, etc.</Spoiler>  
- mi wile kama sona e toki Inli.   <Spoiler>I want to learn English.</Spoiler>  
  - _kama sona_ = learn. This is similar to how _kama jo_ = get, like we learned in lesson six.  
- jan Ana o pana e moku tawa mi.   <Spoiler>Ana, give me food.</Spoiler>  
- o tawa musi poka mi!   <Spoiler>Dance with me!</Spoiler>  
  - If you've forgotten what _tawa musi_ means, we learned it in lesson eight.  
- jan Mose o lawa e mi mute tawa ma pona.   <Spoiler>Moses, lead us to the good land.</Spoiler>  
- tawa pona.   <Spoiler>Good bye (spoken by the person who's staying)</Spoiler>
