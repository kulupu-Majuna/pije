## Vocabulary  

**ala** - not, none; nothing  
**ale** or **ali** - everything, all  
**ken** - can, to be able to; possibility         
**lape** - to sleep; sleep  
>  
  

**musi** - to have fun, to amuse; game, fun  
**pali** - to do, to make, to work; activity, work  
**sona** - to know, to know how to; wisdom  
**wawa** - strong, intense; energy, power

## Negation  
In English, you make a verb negative by adding _doesn't_ or _don't_ in front of the verb, as in the sentence "We **don't** talk". However, Toki Pona puts its negative word, _ala_, after the verb.  
> mi lape ala. -- I'm not sleeping. (literally: "I sleep not.")  
> mi musi ala. -- I'm not having fun.  
> mi wawa ala. -- I'm not strong.  
> mi wile ala tawa musi. -- I don't want to dance.  
>> _tawa musi_ literally means "move entertainingly" or something like that. It's used to mean "dance".  
>
Keep in mind that these _ala_ sentences can often be translated in a variety of ways. For example, the sentence "mi musi ala" can also be translated as "I'm bored"; "mi wawa ala" could be translated as "I'm weak". You just have to be flexible.

Note that _ala_ can also be used as an adjective.  
 jan ala li toki. -- Nobody is talking. (literally: "person none (li) talks.")  

There's nothing wrong with putting _ala_ after the verb (which is _toki_ in this sentence), and in fact that's the more common way of doing it. However, you do have the option of using _ala_ after nouns, and so I just wanted to point that out. However, if you do that, try to remember not use _ala_ with _ijo_:  
> Incorrect: ijo ala li jaki. -- No thing is dirty. (literally: "thing none (li) dirty."  
 Correct: ala li jaki. -- Nothing is dirty.  

If not behind a verb, _ala_ already essentially means _nothing_ by default, and so using _ijo_ just doesn't fit in.

## _ale_ and _ali_  
It might seem odd that I have put the words for _everything_ in with the lesson that's about negation! However, despite the differences in meaning, _ala_ and _ale_ / _ali_ as adjectives are used the same way.

Before we learn how to use this word, I suppose you're wondering why there are two words that mean the exact same thing. Well, the explanation involves phonetics. The word _ali_ has been created fairly recently. Before it, there was only _ale_. However, as you might have already noticed, the words _ale_ and _ala_ are very close in pronunciation. It's easy to confuse these two words in your head, and it's also easy to hear the word wrong when it is spoken aloud. People became more concerned that _ala_ and _ale_ could be confused too easily, and so <Change till={1}>Marraskuu</Change><Change from={1}>Sonja</Change>, the creator of Toki Pona, suggested the word _ali_. It means the exact same thing as _ale_; however, it's separated from _ala_ more and is easier to differentiate. Both _ale_ and _ali_ will exist until it seems that one has become more popular than the other. You can use whichever word you like more; however, I personally prefer _ali_ and so I'll use it in these lessons.

So, anyhow, now let's talk about how to use this word. Just a moment ago, we learned how _ala_ can be used as an adjective. Fortunately, _ali_ is used the exact same way:  
> jan ali li wile tawa. -- Everybody wants to travel.  
 ma ali li pona. -- All nations are good.  

Also like _ala_, it's best not to use _ijo_ and _ali_ together:  
> ~~ijo~~ ali li pona -- Everything is okay.  

By the way, _ali li pona_ is one of the Toki Pona proverbs, if you didn't know that.

## Yes/No Questions  
To ask a question that can be answered by saying "yes" or "no", you follow a simple pattern. Look at how this sentence has been made into a question:  
 sina pona ala pona? -- Are you okay? (literally: "you okay not okay?")  

To make questions like these, you say the verb, then _ala_, then repeat the verb. Now that's not so difficult, is it? It'll just take a while to get accustomed to. Here are more examples:  
> suno li suli ala suli? -- Is the sun big?  
> len sina li telo ala telo? -- Are your clothes wet?  
> tomo tawa sina li pakala ala pakala? -- Is your car messed up?  
> sina ken ala ken lape? -- Can you sleep?  
> ona li lon ala lon tomo? -- Is he in the house?  
> ona li tawa ala tawa ma ike? -- Did he go to the evil land?  
> sina pana ala pana e moku tawa jan lili? -- Did you give food to the child?  
 pipi li moku ala moku e kili? -- Are the bugs eating the fruit?


### Answering
Answering these yes/no questions is quite simple. If someone asked you _sina wile ala wile moku?_ ("Do you want to eat?"), you could answer either yes or no. Here's how to do that:  
> wile -- Yes  
 wile ala -- No  

If you want to say yes, you simply repeat the verb of the sentence. If you want to say no, you repeat the verb and add _ala_ after it. Here are some more questions and their answers:  
> sina lukin ala lukin e kiwen? -- Do you see the rock?  
>> lukin -- Yes  
>
>    lukin ala -- No  
> sina sona ala sona e toki mi? -- Do you understand my talking? Do you understand what I'm saying?  
>> sona -- Yes  
>
    sona ala -- No  


## _tan_ (again)  
You learned _tan_ in the last lesson as a preposition, but now we need to cover its uses as a noun.

When used as a noun, _tan_ means _cause_ or _reason_. Of course, that can be helpful when you want to translate a sentence such as "I don't know why". However, you have to rephrase that sentence a little:  
 mi sona ala e tan. -- I don't know the reason.  

That's all.

## Practice  
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.  

- Is that funny? Yes.   <Spoiler>ni li musi ala musi? musi.</Spoiler>  
- You have to tell me why.   <Spoiler>sina wile toki e tan tawa mi.</Spoiler>  
  - Think: "You have to tell the reason to me."  
- Is a bug beside me?   <Spoiler>pipi li lon ala lon poka mi?</Spoiler>  
- Do you like me?   <Spoiler>mi pona ala pona tawa sina?</Spoiler>  
- I can't sleep.   <Spoiler>mi ken ala lape.</Spoiler>  
- I don't want to talk to you.   <Spoiler>mi wile ala toki tawa sina.</Spoiler>  
- He didn't go to the lake.   <Spoiler>ona li tawa ala telo.</Spoiler>  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  
- sina wile ala wile pali? wile ala.   <Spoiler>Do you want to work? No.</Spoiler>  
- jan utala li seli ala seli e tomo?   <Spoiler>Is the warrior burning the house?</Spoiler>  
- jan lili li ken ala moku e telo nasa.   <Spoiler>Children can't drink beer.</Spoiler>  
- sina kepeken ala kepeken e ni?   <Spoiler>Are you using that?</Spoiler>  
- sina ken ala ken kama?   <Spoiler>Can you come?</Spoiler>
