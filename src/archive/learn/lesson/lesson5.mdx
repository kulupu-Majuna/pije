## Adjectives and compound nouns
As you should already know, Toki Pona has a very minimal vocabulary. The small amount of words, of course, makes the vocabulary much easier to learn. However, as a result, many words do not exist in the language. For example, there is no word that means _friend_. There are also no words for _soldier_, _car_, or _shoe_. Therefore, we often have to combine various words together to equal what might take only one word in English. For example, here's how to say _friend_ in Toki Pona:

> jan <small>(person)</small> + pona <small>(good)</small> = jan pona

_jan pona_ in English literally means _person good_ (or, as we would say in normal English, _good person_). Due to Toki Pona's small vocabulary, though, it also means _friend_.

As you can see, the adjective (which was _pona_ in the above example) goes **after** the noun rather than before it. That's why I said _jan pona_ and not _pona jan_. This will undoubtedly seem incredibly awkward to you if you only speak English. However, many, many languages do this (including Spanish, Italian, and French, which put most of their adjectives after). It won't be easy to break the bonds that English have had on you your entire life, but, speaking from personal experience, the reward is well worth it because you will greatly expand your mind and will be able to think about things in a new, refreshing way.

In addition to adjectives such as _pona_, many of the verbs are often used as adjectives.

1. _jan_ - person  
   _pakala_ - to hurt  
   _jan pakala_ - an injured person, victim, etc.  
2. _ilo_ - tool  
   _moku_ - to eat  
   _ilo moku_ - an eating utensil, such as a fork or spoon

You can add more than just one adjective onto a noun to reach the meaning that you want:

> _jan_ - person  
> _jan utala_ - soldier  
> _jan utala pona_ - good soldier  
> _jan utala pona mute_ - many good soldiers  
> _jan utala pona ni_ - this good soldier

As you might have noticed, _ni_ and _mute_ come at the end of the phrase. This occurs almost always. The reason for this is that the phrases build as you go along, so the adjectives must be put into an organized, logical order. For example, notice the differences in these two phrases:

> _jan utala pona_ - good soldier
> _jan pona utala_ - fighting friend, sidekick, etc.

Here are some handy adjective combinations using words that you've already learned and that are fairly common. Try figuring out what their literal meanings are:

> _ike lukin_* - ugly  
> _jan ike_ - enemy  
> _jan lawa_ - leader  
> _jan lili_ - child  
> _jan sewi_ - god  
> _jan suli_ - adult  
> _jan unpa_ - lover, prostitute  
> _ma telo_ - mud, swamp  
> _ma tomo_ - city, town  
> _mi mute_ - we, us  
> _ona mute_ - they, them  
>> Note: <Change till={1}>You can also say _ali_ (a word we haven't learned yet) to mean
   they; most current speakers seem to prefer this way. However, I, the
   writer of these lessons, prefer _ona mute_, and so I will use it instead.</Change>
   <Change from={1}>Note: While this structure is undoubtedly gramatically correct, most current
   speakers simply use _ona_. You can decide what's most comfortable for you.</Change>
> 
> _pona lukin_* - pretty, attractive  
> _telo nasa_ - alcohol, beer, wine  
> _tomo telo_ - restroom  

<small>* Note that you can only use _pona lukin_ and _ike lukin_ by themselves after _li_. (For example: _jan ni li pona lukin_ - That person is pretty.) There is a way to attach these phrases directly onto the noun using the word pi, but we have more important things to learn before we get to that point.</small>  

There is a much longer list with all the common noun combinations that we use in Toki Pona. However, the list was not designed for this language course, and so many of the combinations use words that you have not learned yet. You can check out the list [here](/learn/noun); just keep this list in mind and check back to it occasionally as you learn more words.

 

## Possessives
To say _my_ and _your_, you use the pronouns and treat them like any other adjective:  
> _tomo mi_ - my house  
> _ma sina_ - your country  
> _telo ona_ - his/her/its water  

Other words are treated the same way:  
> _len jan_ - somebody's clothes  
> _seli suno_ - the sun's heat

 

## Adverbs
I know that we've covered a lot of difficult topics in this lesson. Fortunately, the adverbs in Toki Pona should be quite simple for you, so just keep pushing for a few more minutes and we'll be done.

For adverbs in Toki Pona, the adverb simply follows the verb that it modifies. For example:
> mi lawa **pona** e jan. -- I lead people **well**.
> mi utala **ike**. -- I fight **badly**.
> sina lukin **sewi** e suno. -- You look **up** at the sun.
> ona li wile **mute** e ni. -- He wants that **a lot**.
> mi mute li lukin **lili** e ona. -- We **barely** saw it.

 

## Practice
Firstly, see how well you can read the following poem. You know all the words and concepts, so you should be able to understand it. Then, check your translation for each line of the poem. And now here's the poem:

> mi jo e kili.  
> ona li pona li lili.  
> mi moku lili e kili lili.

<Spoiler>
I have a fruit.  
It is good and is small.  
I nibble (eat a little) the small fruit.
</Spoiler>  



Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.

- The leader drank dirty water.  <Spoiler>jan lawa li moku e telo jaki</Spoiler>  
- I need a fork.  <Spoiler>mi wile e ilo moku</Spoiler>  
- An enemy is attacking them  <Spoiler>jan ike li utala e ona mute   </Spoiler>  
- That bad person has strange clothes  <Spoiler>jan ike ni li jo e len nasa   </Spoiler>  
- We drank a lot of vodka.  <Spoiler>mi mute li moku e telo nasa mute</Spoiler>  
- Children watch adults.  <Spoiler>jan lili li lukin e jan suli</Spoiler>  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:

- mi lukin sewi e tomo suli.  <Spoiler>I am looking up at the big building.</Spoiler>  
- seli suno li seli e tomo mi.  <Spoiler>The sun's warmth heats my home.</Spoiler>  
- jan lili li wile e telo kili.  <Spoiler>Children want fruit juice.</Spoiler>  
- ona mute li nasa e jan suli  <Spoiler>They drove the adults crazy.     </Spoiler>  
  - Notice how even though _nasa_ is typically an adjective, it is used as a verb here. Neat, huh?

 
Â¡Ay caramba! These last two lessons, and especially this one, might have seemed really hard. Now's the time when you'll have to start trying to think for yourself rather than relying on English first. If you haven't quite got it yet, it's okay; these things have to be learned by practice and association, so you'll get it in time. And if you still feel disheartened, think about this: If you've been learning and practicing the vocabulary of these past three sections like you should, you've already learned over a quarter of all the words in Toki Pona! Keep up the good work!
