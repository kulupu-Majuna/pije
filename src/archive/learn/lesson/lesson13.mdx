## Vocabulary  

**jelo** - yellow  
**kule** - color; to paint, to color                     
**laso** - blue  
**loje** - red  
**pimeja** - black, dark  
**sitelen** - picture, image; to draw, to write  
**walo** - white  


## Color combinations  
All right, before we get started with this lesson, make sure you take a good luck at the list of vocabulary for this lesson. Notice how there are no words like _purple_, _green_, or _grey_. That's because these words don't exist in Toki Pona. With that in mind, look at this picture:

![](/images/lesson13a.gif)

What color do you see? Purple, right? Wrong! If you zoomed in on this picture, you'd see that it's actually a grid of many blue and red blocks. Here is a close-up of part of that same picture that you see above:

![](/images/lesson13b.gif)

So you see that blue and red combine to make the color purple. Well, Toki Pona follows this same idea. Check this out:  
> len -- clothing  
> len laso -- blue clothing  
> len laso loje -- reddish blue clothing; thus, purple clothing!  

Personally, I don't like this type of formation, but I do have to admit that it's quite neat.

Using the above method, you can mix different colors to come up with all sorts of different things. Here is a list of some of the common ones:  
> laso loje -- purple ("reddish blue")  
> laso jelo -- green ("yellowish blue")  
> loje jelo -- orange ("yellowish red")  
> loje walo -- pink ("whitish red")  
> walo pimeja -- grey ("dark white")  

You can stack as many colors together as you want, but don't get carried away. After all, Toki Pons is about simplicity, so keep it basic.

Keep in mind that colors by themselves can't really follow any sort of logical pattern, so you're free to mix them around as you like:  
> laso loje -- reddish blue = purple  
> loje laso -- bluish red = purple  
> laso jelo -- yellowish blue = green  
> jelo laso -- bluish yellow = green


### Using colors with _pi_
If you understood the color combination method that I taught above, you pretty much know everything you need about Toki Pona's colors for practical use. However, if you feel so inclined, we can talk about more technical stuff. If you'd rather skip over this part of the lesson, that'll be all right with me. What you'll learn here is seldom used. If you'd like to learn about it, though, keep reading.

Okay, suppose that you have a shirt that looks like this:  

![](/images/lesson13c.gif)

The shirt is obviously made up of _loje_ and _laso_. However, you can't call it _len loje laso_, because that means "purple shirt", as you just saw a few minutes ago earlier in the lesson. So, we have to use _en_ to separate the two colors, and then we have to use _pi_ to show that even though there are two different colors, they both modify the word "shirt":  
> len pi loje en laso -- shirt of red and blue  

Get it? Now let's look at what would've happened if you had not used _pi_ here:  
> len loje en laso li pona. -- A red shirt and blue are good.  

Without _pi_, _laso_ is just left sitting there, and it doesn't have anything to modify. Therefore, that sentence is incorrect. You have to use  _pi_ to show that both _loje_ **and** _laso_ modify _len_.

## _kule_  
This is fairly easy to understand. _kule_ has two main uses, and so I'll cover them one at a time.

### Using _kule_ to ask what color something is
This doesn't need much explanation, if you understand _seme_.  
> ni li kule seme? -- What color is that? ("That is color which?")


### _kule_ as a verb
_kule_ as a verb just means "to color" or "to paint". Here's an example:  
> mi kule e lipu -- I'm coloring the paper.


## Miscellaneous  
The word for today's miscellaneous section is _sitelen_. As a noun it means _picture_ or _image_. As a verb, it means _to draw_ or _to write_.

_sitelen_ is most useful for the compound nouns that you can make with it. _sitelen tawa_ ("motion picture") is used to mean either a movie or a TV show. Here are a few examples:  
> sitelen tawa _The Simpsons_ li pona tawa mi. -- I like the TV show _The Simpsons_.  
> sitelen tawa _The Godfather_ li pona kin. -- The movie _The Godfather_ is good also.  

_sitelen_ can also be used with _ma_ to mean "map":  
> o pana e sitelen ma tawa mi.  

_sitelen ma_, of course, means "picture (of) land".

## Practice  
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.  

- I don't see the blue bag.   <Spoiler>mi lukin ala e poki laso.</Spoiler>  
- A little green person came from the sky.   <Spoiler>jan laso jelo lili li kama tan sewi. or jan jelo laso lili li kama tan sewi.</Spoiler>  
- I like the color purple.   <Spoiler>kule loje laso li pona tawa mi. or kule laso loje li pona tawa mi.</Spoiler>  
- The sky is blue.   <Spoiler>sewi li laso.</Spoiler>  
- Look at that red bug.   <Spoiler>o lukin e pipi loje ni. </Spoiler>  
- I want the map.   <Spoiler>mi wile e sitelen ma.</Spoiler>  
- Do you watch _The X-Files_?   <Spoiler>sina lukin ala lukin e sitelen tawa X-Files?</Spoiler>  
- Which color do you like?   <Spoiler>kule seme li pona tawa sina?</Spoiler>  
  - Think: "Which color is good for you?"  


And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  

- suno li jelo.   <Spoiler>The sun is yellow.</Spoiler>  
- telo suli li laso.   <Spoiler>The big water [ocean] is blue.</Spoiler>  
- mi wile moku e kili loje.   <Spoiler>I want to eat a red fruit.</Spoiler>  
- ona li kule e tomo tawa.   <Spoiler>He's painting the car.</Spoiler>  

And now try reading this Toki Pona poem. It uses poetic expressions, but if you've been studying, you'll be able to enjoy and to appreciate the poem because we've already covered the concepts and vocabulary that this poem uses. And now here's the poem:

ma mi li pimeja.  
kalama ala li lon<Change from={1}>.</Change>  
mi lape. mi sona.

<Spoiler>
My land is dark.  
No sound exists.  
I sleep. I know.
