## Vocabulary  

**pi** - essentially means "of"; see notes below  
**kalama** - sound, noise; to make noise, to play an instrument  
**kulupu** - group, community, society  
**nasin** - road, way, doctrine, method  


## _pi_  
You probably aren't going to like _pi_. It's probably the most misused word in the language, and, personally, I can barely tolerate it. I wish that there were some way to remove _pi_ from Toki Pona, but it's a necessary evil because of the way Toki Pona is constructed. At any rate, if you get frustrated while trying to learn about this word, just relax, try your best, and know that you have my sympathy.

As I said, this word is terribly misused. I've seen all sorts of weird mistakes occur when people try to learn this word. In just a moment we're going to look at a funny mistake that occurred when someone didn't use the word _pi_ but should have.

Now, you might remember from lesson five that _tomo telo_ ("water room") is used to mean _restroom_. You should also recall that _nasa_ means _crazy_, _silly_, _stupid_, and so on. Now, let's look at this sentence:  
> mi tawa tomo telo nasa. -- I went to the crazy restroom. (lit: "I to room water crazy.")  

Okay, I think you'll agree with me when I say that that is just plain weird. It makes me think about some creepy restroom with neon lights lining the floor and a strobe light in every toilet stall. Now, the person who said this sentence had actually been trying to say that he had gone to a bar. As you probably recall, _telo nasa_ is used to mean alcohol. So, a _tomo_ with _telo nasa_ would be a bar. The only problem is that you can't fit _tomo_ and _telo nasa_ together, because it will mean "crazy restroom," as you just studied. The only way to fix this problem is to use _pi_:  
> tomo **pi** telo nasa -- building **of** alcohol; a bar, pub, etc.

The problem is fixed. Yay! So, you see, **_pi_ is used to separate a noun from another noun that has an adjective**. If you like to think about things in a formulaic, patterned way, here's another way of thinking about it:  
> (noun 1) pi (noun 2) (an adjective that modifies noun 2, but NOT noun 1)  

Note that there **must** be an adjective to describe noun 2. If not, _pi_ is not used at all, and you get this:  
> (noun 1) (noun 2)  

Also, if you're familiar with scheme notation (if you're not, just skip ahead to the next paragraph), here is a layout of the _tomo (pi) telo nasa_ example that I gave above:  
> crazy restroom = ((tomo telo) nasa)  
> bar = (tomo pi (telo nasa))


There. I hope I explained _pi_ easily enough so that it's fairly simple to understand. We're going to go over a bunch of examples using _pi_; but, you need to be familiar with some of the compound noun combinations that we've learned. Most of the ones that we've learned were in lesson five, if you want to review them. You can also find a lot of them on <Change till={1}>tokipona.org</Change><Change from={1}>the official site</Change>, but some of the words you haven't learned yet. At any rate, let's get on with the examples.  
> jan pi ma tomo -- person of the city, a city-dweller  
> kulupu pi toki pona -- group of Toki Pona, the Toki Pona community  
> nasin pi toki pona -- ways of Toki Pona, the ideology behind Toki Pona  
> jan lawa pi jan utala -- leader of soldiers, a commander or general  
> jan lawa pi tomo tawa kon -- leader of airplanes, a pilot  
> jan pi nasin sewi Kolisu - person of Christian religion, a Christian  
>> _nasin sewi_ = religion  
>
> jan pi pona lukin -- person of visual goodness, an attractive person  
> jan pi ike lukin -- person of visual badness, an ugly person  

If you don't understand how I got these examples (especially the first five there), you might want to go back and study a little more, come by the Toki Pona chat room for help, or find someone else who can help you.

Okay, now let's talk about making possessives. If you wanted to say "my house" you say _tomo mi_. Similarly, "your house" is _tomo sina_. However, if you want to name a specific person who owns the house, you have to use _pi_:  
> tomo pi jan Lisa -- house of Lisa, Lisa's house  

Note that you can not say _tomo Lisa_. That changes the whole meaning of the phrase. Here are more examples:  
> kili mi -- my fruit  
> kili pi jan Susan -- Susan's fruit  
> ma ona -- her country  
> ma pi jan Keli -- Keli's country  
> len jan -- somebody's clothes  
> len pi jan Lisa -- Lisa's clothes  

Also, if you want to use the plural pronouns _mi mute_ ("we") or _ona mute_ ("they"), you have to use _pi_:  
> nimi pi mi mute -- our names  
> tomo pi ona mute -- their house  

If you left out _pi_ here, the order of the adjectives would be illogical and the phrase would not make sense.

We also use _pi_ to express the opposite of some words:  
> jan wawa -- strong person  
> jan pi wawa ala -- "person of no strength"; a weak person  

You could not have said _jan wawa ala_ because that would mean "no strong people".  

### _Common mistakes_
One common mistake I see is <Change till={1}>that</Change><Change from={1}>when</Change> people try to use _pi_ to mean "about" (as in "We talked about something."). While _pi_ can be used in this way, most people use it too much. Here is a common, but incorrect, way of using _pi_ to mean "about" in a sentence, and then the correct way of saying it:  
> Incorrect: mi toki pi jan. -- I talked about people.  
> Correct: mi toki jan. -- I talked about people  

The "about" is simply implied by the sentence. Now here's another sentence which is correct and in which _pi_ is used to mean "about":  
> mi toki pi jan ike. -- I talked about bad people.  

The reason that _pi_ can be used here is because _jan ike_ is its own singular, individual concept, and the combined phrase (_jan ike_) acts on _toki_ as one thing; _pi_ is simply used to distinguish the _jan ike_ phrase. If you left out _pi_, both _jan_ and _ike_ would become adverbs, and the sentence would mean something really strange like "Humanely, I talked evilly."

Another common mistake is that people simply get very happy with their _pi_ and start using it for everything. For example, we already know that _jan lawa_ means "leader". However, after learning a little about _pi_, some people say things like _jan pi lawa_. Or, to say "countryman" (which should be said _jan ma_), they'll say _jan pi ma_. I really don't know why this mistake occurs; I can't figure it out. But at any rate, **these phrases are wrong, because the second noun does not have an adjective to modify it**. Do you remember the little formula?:  
> (noun 1) pi (noun 2) (an adjective that modifies noun 2, but NOT noun 1)

**The word immediately after the _pi_ must have another word that describes it.**


Another mistake is that people use _pi_ when they should use _tan_:  
> Correct: mi kama tan ma Mewika. -- I come from America.  
> Incorrect: mi kama pi ma Mewika.


## Miscellaneous  
Since learning _pi_ is already hard enough by itself, we're going to take it easy and learn just one word for today's lesson: _kalama_.

Okay, _kalama_ is used to mean "sound" or "noise":  
> kalama ni li seme? -- What was that noise?


_kalama_ is usually combined with the word _musi_ to mean "music" or "song":  
> kalama musi li pona tawa mi. -- I like music.  

Just as _jan_ precedes people's names, _kalama musi_ precedes the names of specific songs:  
> kalama musi "Jingle Bells" li pona tawa mi. -- I like the song "Jingle Bells<Change till={1}>".</Change><Change from={1}>."</Change>  

And we can use that handy word _pi_ to talk about music by a certain group or artist:  
> kalama musi pi jan Elton-John li nasa. -- The music of Elton John is odd.


Finally, _kalama_ can be used as a verb:  
> mi kalama kepeken ilo. -- I make noise using an instrument.  
> o kalama ala! -- Don't make noise!


### Using _nasin_ to make "how"
Since we've covered _nasin_ in this lesson, I need to point out one quick thing about it. Look at this sentence:  
> sina pali e ni kepeken nasin seme? -- You made this using what method? How did you make this?  

I think that this is pretty easy, so I won't drag it out more. But have you noticed how _seme_ is used for all the question words? In the last lesson, we saw _jan seme_ (who) and _tan seme_ (why), and now we have _kepeken nasin seme_ as "how".
