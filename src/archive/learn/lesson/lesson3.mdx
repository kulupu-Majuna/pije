### Grammatical Words

## Sentences with _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject
Okay, one of the first principles you'll need to learn about Toki Pona is that there is no form of the verb to be like there is in English. For example:

> mi pona. = I _(am)_ good.  
> sina suli. = you _(are)_ big/important.

Simply state _mi_ or _sina_, then complete the sentence with a verb or adjective. These are the absolute simplest type of sentences in Toki Pona, but already you've come across something that you're probably not accustomed to: All those beloved words like _is_, _was_, and _will_ be are gone. Say goodbye! Although this might seem strange to you, it's actually simpler, if you think about it. There are other languages that don't have a form of _to be_, so don't think this lack of _to be_ is completely strange. It'll just take some practice to get used to the idea.

 

## The Ambiguity of Toki Pona
Okay, now comes another concept which will probably seem odd to you. Do you see how several of the words in the vocabulary have multiple meanings? For example, _suli_ can mean either long or tall... or big... or important. By now, you might be wondering, "What's going on? How can one word mean so many different things?" Well, welcome to the world of Toki Pona! The truth is that lots of words are like this in Toki Pona. Because the language has such a small vocabulary and is so basic, the ambiguity is inevitable. However, this vagueness is not necessarily a bad thing: Because of the vagueness, a speaker of Toki Pona is forced to focus on the very basic, unaltered aspect of things, rather than focusing on many minute details.

Another way that Toki Pona is ambiguous is that it can not specify whether a word is singular (There is only one thing.) or plural (There is more than one thing.) For example, _jan_ can mean either "person" **or** "people". -- If you've decided that Toki Pona is too arbitrary and that not having plurals is simply the final straw, don't be so hasty. Toki Pona is not the only language that doesn't specify whether a noun is plural or not. Japanese, for example, does the same thing. So, if you learn the concept now in Toki Pona, you will gain some of the same skills in a much shorter time. That's a comforting thought, now isn't it?

 

## The "Verb"
And now we're going to study yet another thing that will probably seem weird to you. Observe these examples:

> mi moku. = I eat. **OR** I am food.  
> sina pona. = You are good. **OR** You fix.

Once again, you can see the ambiguity of Toki Pona. Because Toki Pona lacks _to be_, the exact meaning is lost. _moku_ in this sentence could be a verb, or it could be a noun; just as _pona_ could be an adjective or could be a verb. In situations such as these, the listener must rely on context. After all, how often do you hear someone say _I am food_? I hope not very often! You can be fairly certain that _mi moku_ means _I'm eating_.  
For sentences like _sina pona_, there is another way that will let you specify what you mean, but you'll learn about that in the next lesson.

### The Lack of Tense
The "verbs" in Toki Pona have no tense.
   mi pona. = I am good. **OR** I was good. **OR** I will be good.
This is yet another example of the vagueness of Toki Pona. If it's absolutely necessary, there are ways of saying that something happened in the past, present, or future, but it will be a long while before you learn about that.

 

## Sentences without _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject
We've already looked at _mi_ and _sina_ sentences, which are the simplest sentences possible in Toki Pona. For sentences that don't use _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject, there is one small catch that you'll have to learn. It's not very complex; it'll just take some practice to remember to use it. Look at how _li_ is used:

> telo li pona. = Water _(is)_ good.  
> suno li suli. = _(The)_ sun _(is)_ big.  
> moku li pona. = Eating/food _(is)_ good.

li is a grammatical word that separates the subject from its "verb". Remember: It's only used when the subject is **not** _mi_ or _sina_. Although _li_ might seem worthless right now, as you continue to learn Toki Pona you will see that some sentences could be very confusing if _li_ weren't there. So, try to practice using it whenever you get a chance until it becomes normal to you.

 

## Practice
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.

- People are good. <Spoiler>jan li pona</Spoiler>.
- I'm eating. <Spoiler>mi moku.</Spoiler>
- You're tall. <Spoiler>sina suli.</Spoiler>
- Water is simple. <Spoiler>telo li pona.</Spoiler>
- The lake is big. <Spoiler>telo li suli.</Spoiler>

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:
   
- suno li suli. <Spoiler>The sun is big.</Spoiler>
- mi suli. <Spoiler>I'm important. OR  I'm fat.</Spoiler>
- jan li moku. <Spoiler>Somebody is eating.</Spoiler>
