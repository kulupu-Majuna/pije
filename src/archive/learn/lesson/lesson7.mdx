## Vocabulary  

### Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives

**anpa** - ground; low, deep; to lower, to defeat         
**insa** - inside, stomach  
**monsi** - rear, back, behind  
**sewi** - high, above, roof, top, sky  
  
### Usually Prepositions
**sama** - same, similar  
**tan** - reason, cause; because of  
**poka** - side; beside, nearby, with

## _anpa_, _insa_, _monsi_, and _sewi_  
Although you might be tempted to use these words as prepositions, they are actually nouns. You have to use another preposition along with these words. Here are some examples.  
> ona li lon sewi mi. -- "He is in my above." He is above me.  
> pipi li lon anpa mi. -- The bug is underneath me.  
> moku li lon insa mi. -- Food is inside me.  
> len li lon monsi mi. -- Clothes are behind me.  

So you see, these words as used here are nouns, and _mi_ is a possessive pronoun meaning "my". So _sewi mi_ means something like "my above" or "the area that is above me". And since these words are merely nouns, you must still have a verb; in the above examples, _lon_ is acting as the verb. Don't forget to include a verb!

Since these words aren't prepositions, they are free for other uses, just like any other noun/adjective/verb:  
> _monsi_ as a body part  
>> _monsi_ can mean either the back or the butt  
>
> anpa as a verb  
>> mi anpa e jan utala. -- I defeated the warrior.
>

## _sama_, and _tan_  
In and of themselves, these words are more or less common sense to use, but I need to point out a few things just to make sure that everything's clear.

### _sama_
This word can be used for several different parts of speech, but I don't think that it's too difficult to understand. Let's look at a few examples:  
> jan ni li sama mi. -- That person is like me.  
> ona li lukin sama pipi. -- He looks like a bug.  
> sama li ike. -- Equality is bad.  
Easy, right? Let's move on to _tan_.

### _tan_
I can't cover everything that you need to know about this preposition yet. However, it is the last Toki Pona preposition, and so it needs to be at least introduced here.

Again, let's look at an example:  
> mi moku tan ni: mi wile moku.  
This literally says "I eat because-of this: I want to-eat". A more casual translation would be "I eat because I'm hungry".

That's about all for this word. (Yay!) You'll see it again when we start learning about asking questions in Toki Pona, but it means the same thing then, too.

## poka  
_poka_ is rather unique in that it can act both as a noun/adjective and also as a preposition. Let's look at each of these uses separately.

### _poka_ as a noun/adjective
This use is the same as you saw earlier in _anpa_, _insa_, _monsi_, and _sewi_. Here are some examples:  
> ona li lon poka mi. -- He is at my side. He is beside me.  
> jan poka -- neighbor; someone who is beside you  
> poka telo -- "water side"; in other words, the beach

### _poka_ as a preposition
Unlike _anpa_ and the rest, _poka_ can also be used directly as a preposition. These two sentences below have the same meaning, but you go about them in a different way:  
> mi moku poka jan pona mi. -- I ate beside my friend.  
> mi moku lon poka pi jan pona mi. -- I ate at side of my friend.  
So, you see, you can treat _poka_ either as a noun/adjective or as a preposition. It's up to you, but whichever way you choose you can still express your thought. Here is another example:  
> mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa. -- I fought an enemy with a drunk guy.  
> mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa. -- I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy.  
That's not so bad, now is it?

## Practice  
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.  

- My friend is beside me.   <Spoiler>jan pona mi li lon poka mi.</Spoiler>  
- The sun is above me.   <Spoiler>suno li lon sewi mi.</Spoiler>  
- The land is beneath me.   <Spoiler>ma li lon anpa mi.</Spoiler>  
- Bad things are behind me.   <Spoiler>ijo ike li lon monsi mi.</Spoiler>  
- I'm okay because I'm alive.   <Spoiler>mi pona tan ni: mi lon.</Spoiler>  
  - _lon_ as a verb by itself means _to exist_, _to be real_, etc. It was  
    mentioned like that when you learned the word in lesson six,  
     although we didn't directly cover it in the lessons. 

- I look at the land beside my friend.   <Spoiler>mi lukin e ma poka jan pona mi. OR mi lukin e ma lon poka pi jan pona mi.</Spoiler>  
- People look like ants.   <Spoiler>jan li lukin sama pipi.</Spoiler>
And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  

- poka mi li pakala.   <Spoiler>My hip hurts.</Spoiler>  
- mi kepeken e poki e ilo moku.   <Spoiler>I'm using a bowl and a spoon.</Spoiler>  
- jan li lon insa tomo.   <Spoiler>Somebody's inside the house.</Spoiler>
