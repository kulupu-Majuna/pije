### Grammatical Words
**e** - introduces direct object (see notes below)

 

## Direct objects using _e_
In lesson three, we saw how phrases such as _mi moku_ could have two potential meanings: _I'm eating_ or _I am food_. You have to rely on context heavily in these situations. However, there is one way to specify that you want to say _I'm eating_ versus _I am food_. Observe:

> mi moku e kili. = I eat fruit.  
> ona li lukin e pipi. = He's watching the bug.

Whatever is getting action done on itself is the "direct object," and in Toki Pona, we separate the verb and the direct object with e so that there is no confusion.

Also in lesson three we discussed how _sina pona_, like _mi moku_, has two possible meanings: _You are good_ or _You're fixing_. Normally, it would mean _You are good_ simply because no one really says _I'm fixing_ without actually telling what it is that they are trying to fix. With _e_, you can now specify:

> ona li pona e ilo. = She's fixing the machine.  
> mi pona e ijo. = I'm fixing something.

If you have had the opportunity to study a language such as Latin, German, or Esperanto, the direct object should not be too difficult for you. Otherwise, try to practice using it (And don't forget to keep practicing _li_ as well.). Once you get a little further into Toki Pona, you'll see why _e_ is necessary.

 

## Direct objects using _e_ with _wile_
If you need to say that you want to do something, follow this example:

> mi wile lukin e ma. = I want to see the countryside.  
> mi wile pakala e sina. = I must destroy you.

As you can see, _e_ doesn't come until after the infinitive in these two sentences, rather than before it. A few people have mistakenly said things such as, "mi wile **e** pakala e sina," so now you can be on your guard against this mistake.

 

## Compound sentences
There are two ways to make compound sentences in Toki Pona; one way involves using _li_, and the other way involves using _e_. Since you've now studied both of these words, we'll cover how to use both of them to make compound sentences. Observe:
> pipi li lukin li unpa.  

This would be translated as, "The bug looks and has sex." By putting _li_ before each verb, you can show how the subject, which is _pipi_ in this case, does more than one thing.
> mi moku li pakala.  

This says, "I eat and destroy." While _li_ is still omitted before _moku_ because the subject of the sentence is _mi_ (Look back over lesson three if you've forgotten this rule), we still use it before the second verb, _pakala_. Without the _li_ there, the sentence would be chaotic and confusing. Compound sentences with _sina_ follow this same pattern.

The other type of compound sentence is used when there are several direct objects of the same verb, like in this following example:
> mi moku e kili e telo.  

This says "I eat/drink fruit and water." _e_ is used multiple times because _kili_ and _telo_ are both direct objects, and so _e_ must precede them both. Here's another example:

> mi wile lukin e ma e suno. -- I want to see the land and the sun.  

Whew! That was a bit confusing. You might want to take some time to re-read what all has been said or reflect on it. When you think you're ready, try these practice exercises:

 

## Practice
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.


- I have a tool. <Spoiler>mi jo e ilo.</Spoiler>  
- She's eating fruit. <Spoiler>ona li moku e kili.</Spoiler>  
- Something is watching me. <Spoiler>ijo li lukin e mi.</Spoiler>  
- He wants to squish the spider. <Spoiler>ona li wile pakala e pipi.</Spoiler>  
- Pineapple is a food and is good. <Spoiler>kili li moku li pona.</Spoiler>  
- The bug is thirsty. <Spoiler>pipi li wile moku e telo.</Spoiler>  
*Think of the sentence like this: "The bug wants to drink water."*

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:
- mi lukin e ni. <Spoiler> I am looking at that.</Spoiler>
- mi wile unpa e ona. <Spoiler> I want to have sex with him/her.</Spoiler>
- jan li wile jo e ma. <Spoiler> People want to own land.</Spoiler>
- mi jan li suli. <Spoiler> I am somebody and am important.</Spoiler>
