## Body Parts
All the words that you see above in the vocabulary list are used to make the name of a body part. However, some of the words have other uses as well. So, I've made this handy chart. Parts of the body which can be expressed in Toki Pona have a number labelling them. Once you get a number, go to the table below the chart. There, you can learn how to say the name of that body part and also learn about the other uses of the words that are used to make the name of that body part.

![](/images/lesson15a.jpg)

1. _oko_ means _eye_ in Toki Pona. Unlike most of the other words, it doesn't really have any other uses.
2. To say _nose_ in Toki Pona, you'd usually say _nena_. However, the word _nena_ actually means any type of extrusion; it can mean a hill, for example. It's also used for a few other body parts. If you need to specify, you can say nena kon (because your nose is what detects smells in the air, after all).
3. To say _mouth_, you use _uta_. This word is also used to say _teeth_: _ijo uta walo_, which literally means "white mouth things".
4. The general word for _hair_ is _linja_. If you want to specify the hair on your head, say _linja lawa_ ("hair (of) head"). -- _linja_ can also mean any type of linear thing, not just hair; so beware of that.
5. In addition to meaning _to lead_ like you've learned in earlier lessons, _lawa_ is also used to mean _head_.
6. The closest that we can come to saying _neck_ in Toki Pona is with _anpa lawa_, which actually means "bottom (of) head". Hehe.
7. _luka_ is used to mean both _hand_ and _arm_. There isn't a way to specify which of the two you mean. That's just another one of those nuisances of Toki Pona. -- You can also use this word to make a word for mittens or gloves: _len luka_, ("hand clothing").
8. You've already learned the word for _hip_, but I just figured I'd point it out again since this is a lesson on the body. The word is _poka_, and you've already studied its other uses.
9. Similar to _luka_, _noka_ means both _leg_ and _foot_. -- You can combine it with _len_, too. _len noka_ generally is used to mean shoe, but it can also mean pants or any other type of clothing for the legs or feet.
10. The word for the the chest and abdomen is _sinpin_. It actually was more intended to mean _front_ or _wall_, but the chest and abdomen are on the front of the body, after all, and are regarded as being a big surface, like a wall. Occasionally, _sinpin_ is also used to mean a person's face.  
  Two other particular body parts which you can find on a female's _sinpin_ are the _nena sike_, which actually means "circular extrusions". You might want to add _meli_ to the end of this phrase if you think there might be some confusion.
11. These body parts vary depending on whether the person is male or female. To say "penis", we use _palisa_. In fact, _palisa_ is used for any object that is long and pointy-like, such as a stick from a tree. A man's testicles would be referred to as _sike_. Depending on the situation and context, you may need to add _mije_ to the end of each of these words to make sure that there is no confusion. -- If you're talking about a female's parts, we simply use _lupa_. _lupa_ can denote any type of hole or opening, such as a door or window. Once again, depending on context, you might want to add _meli_ to the end of _lupa_ for clarity.
12. To say ear in Toki Pona, we say _nena kute_, which means "extrusion (of) hearing". After all, the ear really does extrude from the rest of the head, and it's used to hear things, of course!  
 _kute_ can also be used a verb:  
  mi kute e toki sina. -- I hear your talking. I hear what you're saying.  
  mi kute e kalama musi. -- I'm listening to music.

Also, since the picture was of the front of the body, I couldn't give an arrow for the back, obviously. Just remember that _monsi_ is used to denote a person's back.

There's no way I could put an arrow on the person's skin, because it would simply look out of place. At any rate, _selo_ is used to mean skin. It can also mean the bark of a tree or any other type of external covering of something.

### Bodily Fluids and Wastes

|              |                  |
|--------------|------------------|
|telo walo mije|This is the fluid that a man releases during unpa. If you have a good context, and it's obvious what you're talking about, you could drop walo and/or mije, leaving just telo.|
|telo jelo     |This phrase is used to mean urine. It actually means "yellow fluid". Here is a common sentence using telo jelo: <blockquote>mi pana e telo jelo. -- I released the yellow fluid. I peed.</blockquote>|
|ko jaki	     |This phrase is used to mean feces. <blockquote>mi pana e ko jaki. -- I crapped.</blockquote> ko is not used very much at all, except to say ko jaki. However, you can say "porridge" by saying ko moku.|
|telo sijelo loje|This phrase actually means red bodily fluid, and it's used to mean blood.|

 

### Practice
Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.

- Kiss me.   <Spoiler>o pilin e uta mi kepeken uta sina.</Spoiler>  
  - We sorta have an idiom for this. Think: "Touch my mouth using your mouth."
- I need to pee.   <Spoiler>mi wile pana e telo jelo.</Spoiler>  
- My hair is wet.   <Spoiler>linja mi li telo.</Spoiler>  
- Something is in my eye.   <Spoiler>ijo li lon oko mi.</Spoiler>  
- I can't hear your talking.   <Spoiler>mi ken ala kute e toki sina.</Spoiler>  
- I need to crap.   <Spoiler>mi wile pana e ko jaki.</Spoiler>  
- That hole is big.   <Spoiler>lupa ni li suli.</Spoiler>  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:
- a! telo sijelo loje li kama tan nena kute mi!   <Spoiler>Ahh! Blood is coming from my ear!</Spoiler>  
- selo mi li wile e ni: mi pilin e ona.   <Spoiler>My skin wants this: I touch it. (This is how we say that our skin itches.)</Spoiler>  
  - This sentence is sorta idiomatic. Look at the answer if you can't figure it out.
- o pilin e nena.   <Spoiler>Touch the button.</Spoiler>  
- o moli e pipi kepeken palisa.   <Spoiler>Kill the roach with the stick.</Spoiler>  
- luka mi li jaki. mi wile telo e ona.   <Spoiler>My hands are dirty. I want to wash them.</Spoiler>  
- o pana e sike tawa mi.   <Spoiler>Give the ball to me.</Spoiler>  
- mi pilin e seli sijelo sina.   <Spoiler>I feel your bodily warmth.</Spoiler>
