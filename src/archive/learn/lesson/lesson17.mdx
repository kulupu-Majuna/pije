## Vocabulary  

**la** - separates adverb of  context from sentence  
**mun** - moon, lunar  
**open** - to open, to begin, to turn on  
**pini** - end; to end, to stop, to turn off  
**tenpo** - time  


Also make sure you remember what _kama_ and _ni_ mean, because they will be used a lot with _la_ phrases.

## _la_  
For most people, learning how to use this word is the most difficult concept in the language. Although I personally think that _pi_ is harder, _la_ is still fairly difficult. Fortunately, this is the last concept that you'll have to learn in this course!

_la_ can be broken down into three different sub-uses. So, I'm going to cover each of these sub-uses one at a time. Let's begin.

## _la_ Preceded by a Single Word  
First, let's look at a regular sentence, then we'll look at the same sentence with a _la_ phrase attached:  
> ilo li pakala. -- The tool is broken.  
> ken la ilo li pakala. -- Maybe the tool is broken.  

So already you can see that _la_ phrases come at the beginning of the sentence. The word or phrase that will affect the sentence comes first, then _la_, and then finally comes the main sentence.

I wish I could logically explain why _ken_, when it comes before _la_, means "maybe". However, there's not really a good explanation. If you don't understand it, this is one of those things you'll just have to accept and use as it is. At any rate, here are a few more examples:  
> ken la jan Lisa li jo e ona. -- Maybe Lisa has it.  
> ken la ona li lape. -- Maybe he's alseep.  
> ken la mi ken tawa ma Elopa. -- Maybe I can go to Europe.


## Time and _la_  
Before we can actually learn how to use _tenpo_ with _la_, we need to learn about _tenpo_ first. _tenpo_ is pretty simple, really. It acts just like any other noun. Here is a handy list of many of the common phrases you can make using _tenpo_:  
> tenpo suno -- "sun time"; day  
> tenpo pimeja -- "dark time"; night  
> tenpo ni -- "this time"; the current time, the present  
> tenpo suno ni -- "this sun time"; today  
> tenpo pimeja ni -- "this dark time"; tonight  
> tenpo kama -- "coming time"; the future  
> tenpo kama lili -- "little coming time"; soon  
> tenpo pini -- "past time"; the past  
> tenpo suno pini -- "past sun time"; yesterday  
> tenpo pimeja pini -- "past dark time"; last night  
> tenpo suno kama -- "coming sun time"; tomorrow  
> tenpo mute -- "many times"; often


Now, you can stick these phrases before _la_ to tell when something happened:  
> tenpo pini la mi weka. -- In the past, I was away.  
> tenpo ni la mi lon. -- At this time, I am here.  
> tenpo kama la mi lape. -- In the future, I'll sleep.  
> tenpo pimeja pini la mi kama nasa. -- Last night, I became drunk.


We also use a _tenpo la_ phrase to talk about age. Just to warn you, we talk about age using a funny, idiomatic-like expression. Here's how to ask "How old are you?":  
> tenpo pi mute seme la sina sike e suno? -- Times of what amount (la) you circled the sun?  

Yes, I know that seems silly. But that's essentially what you've done everytime you have a birthday. Birthdays come once a year, and each time you have a birthday, you have gone around the sun one complete time. And that's how we get the phrase. ---- To answer and tell someone how old you are, just replace the _pi mute seme_ with your age:  
> tenpo tu tu la mi sike e suno. -- Four times (la) I circled the sun.


## Expressing if/when with _la_  
Study this example:  
> mama mi li moli la mi pilin ike. -- My parents die, I feel bad.  

In casual English, we'd translate this as "If my parents were to die, I'd be sad." All _la_ phrases follow the same order as that example. If you like formulas and patterns, here's a good way to think about it:  
> 1 la 2. -- If/when 1 happens, then 2 happens also.  

If you're not good at patterns, I'll explain a little bit more for you. When you say a sentence in English like "If I learn, then I am smart", you can switch this over into Toki Pona like this:  
> I learn (la) I am smart.  

The word _if_ (or _when_, depending on the sentence; both essentially mean the same thing) vanishes. The part of the sentence that went along with _if_ (which in this example is the "I learn" part) goes before _la_. The word _then_ also vanishes, and the part of the sentence that went with _then_ (the "I am smart" part) comes after _la_. Here are some more examples:  
> mi lape la ali li pona. -- When I'm asleep, everything is good.  
> sina moku e telo nasa la sina nasa. -- If you drink beer, you'll be silly.  
> sina moli la sina ken ala toki. -- If you are dead, you can't speak.  
> mi pali mute la mi pilin ike. -- When I work a lot, I feel bad.


## Miscellaneous  
For the final thing that you'll have to learn in this course, I want to teach you about the comparative and superlative. If you're wondering what a comparative or superlative is, it's essentially what you're using in English when you use _more_ and _most_, or _-er_ and _-est_. Here are two examples in English, with the comparative or superlative form in bold:  
> He's the **fastest** person in the world.  
> John is **more enthusiastic** than Henry.  

Now to use this concept in Toki Pona, you have to split your idea up into two separate sentences. Here's how you'd say "Lisa is better than Susan.":  
> jan Lisa li pona mute. jan Susan li pona lili. -- Lisa is very good. Susan is a little good.  

Make sense? You say that one thing is very much of something, while you use another object as the basis for comparison and say that it's only a little bit of something. Here are more examples:  
> mi suli mute. sina suli lili. -- I'm bigger than you.  
> mi moku mute. sina moku lili. -- I eat more than you.


## Practice  
Try changing these sentences from English into Toki Pona.  
- Maybe Susan will come.   <Spoiler>ken la jan Susan li kama.</Spoiler>  
- Last night I watched X-Files.   <Spoiler>tenpo pimeja pini la mi lukin e sitelen tawa X-Files.</Spoiler>  
- If the enemy comes, burn these papers.   <Spoiler>jan ike li kama la o seli e lipu ni.</Spoiler>  
- Maybe he's in school.   <Spoiler>ken la ona li lon tomo sona.</Spoiler>  
- I have to work tomorrow.   <Spoiler>tenpo suno kama la mi wile pali.</Spoiler>  
- When it's hot, I sweat.   <Spoiler>seli li lon la mi pana e telo tan selo mi.</Spoiler>
  - Think: "Heat is present, I emit fluid from my skin."  
- Open the door.   <Spoiler>o open e lupa.</Spoiler>  
- The moon is big tonight.   <Spoiler>tenpo pimeja ni la mun li suli.</Spoiler>  

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:  

- ken la jan lili li wile moku e telo.   <Spoiler>Maybe the baby is thirsty.</Spoiler>  
- tenpo ali la o kama sona!   <Spoiler>Always learn!</Spoiler>  
- sina sona e toki ni la sina sona e toki pona!   <Spoiler>Figure this one out for yourself. :o)</Spoiler>
