Here is a neat Toki Pona atlas.

If you're interested, the maps I used come from National Geographic's [Xpeditions maps](https://web.archive.org/web/20050212134835/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/).

This basic atlas is an attempt to showcase the vocabulary for nations that Toki Pona has. For interests of space, the nations on these maps are not preceded by the word ma, as they should normally be included in writing and speaking. Keep that in mind if you want to use the maps as a resource to write about a certain nation.

To see the maps, simply click the links below. Use your back button if you want to return to this page.
