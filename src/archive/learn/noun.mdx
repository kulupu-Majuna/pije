## Adjective Phrases  
> The following phrases are adjective phrases. If you're going to attach them directly onto a noun,  
> you must add pi before the phrase. And from my experience with Toki Pona, each noun can have  
> only one pi phrase. If you feel the need to use more, then that's probably because you're trying to  
> be too specific.  

**ike lukin** - ugly  
**ike moku** - nasty  
**pona lukin** - beautiful, attractive  
**pona moku** - tasty, delicious  
**mute lili** - some, few, not a lot  
   This phrase is the one exception of this group. You could add pi  
   and it would certainly still make sense, but it's not customary  
   to use pi when attaching this phrase onto a noun.  

## Full Sentence Combinations  
> There are some concepts in Toki Pona for which one has to use a full sentence to express, even  
> though in English many of these concepts can be summed up in just one adjective or one verb. Also,  
> note how most of these phrases begin with li. If your subject is mi or sina, you need to drop the word li.  

**li awen pona** - to be patient  
**li ike tawa** - to be disliked by  
   Add the name of whatever is disliked to the beginning of the sentence.  
   Add the name of whatever dislikes that thing at the end of the sentence.  
**li jo e mani mute** - to be rich  
**li kama olin e** - to fall in love with  
**li pana e ko jaki** - to crap  
**li pana e kon jaki** - to fart, to stink  
**li pana e kon pi pilin pona** - to laugh  
**li pana e telo jelo** - to urinate  
**(Person A) li pilin e uta (person B) kepeken uta (pronoun for person A)** - Person A kisses person B.  
   If you're using a pronoun for the two people, just substitute that word into the  
   blanks. If you want to use a specific name for person B, add in pi jan between  
   the word uta and person B's name.  
**li pilin ike** - to feel sad, to be afraid  
**li pilin pona** - to feel glad/happy  
**li pilin wawa** - to be proud/excited  
**li pini e lape ona** - to wake him/her up  
   Or to use a person's actual name:  
   li pini e lape pi jan (person's name here)** - to wake up (person's name here)  
**li pona tawa** - to be liked by  
   Add the name of whatever is liked to the beginning of the sentence.  
   Add the name of whatever likes that thing at the end of the sentence.  
**li toki e lon** - to tell the truth  
**li toki e pona tawa jan (person's name here)** - to thank/praise/honor (person's name here)  
   li toki e pona tawa ona** - to thank/praise/honor him/her  
**li toki utala** - to argue/debate

**tenpo (number) la jan (person) li sike e suno. -- (Person) is (number) years old.  
   Or to use just a pronoun:  
   tenpo (number) la ona li sike e suno. -- He/she is (number) years old.

## Hypothetical Phrases  
> I've come up with a few phrases which I think are correct, but I've never seen them actually used and  
> haven't confirmed their correctness with anyone else. I'm more certain about some of these phrases  
> than I am for others.  

**ilo oko** - eyeglasses  
**jan lili li lon insa ona.** - She is pregnant.  
   Or to use an actual person's name:  
   jan lili li lon insa pi jan (person's name here) -- (Person's name here) is pregnant.  
**jan wawa pi nasin lawa** - police officer  
**kalama musi ma** - country music

**kalama musi pi tawa musi** - techno, disco, dance music

   I also think mama suli could possibly be used.
