import Change from '@components/Change.astro'

**iki** - 
<Change till={1}>This word still remains in the dictionary because it was once very common and still exists in some older texts. It is the older equivalent of the current word ona, meaning "he, she, it". As far as I can tell, this change occurred sometime around early June, 2002. The primary reason for changing the word was that iki was too similar to the word for "bad," _ike_.</Change>
<Change from={1}>the older equivalent of <i>ona</i> (he, she, it). The word was switched with <i>ona</i> in early June 2002 mostly because it was too similar to the word for "bad," <i>ike</i>. Although it had been dropped from use, <i>iki</i> remained for a while in the official dictionary because so many texts had already been written that contained the word.</Change>

**kan** - <Change from={1}>the word for "with" or "among."</Change> <Change till={1}>_kan_ is dead, but it certainly went down screaming and thrashing!</Change> <Change from={1}>The dropping of this word from usage has a rocky history:</Change> <Change till={1}>Around</Change><Change from={1}>In</Change> the summer of 2003, Sonja removed this word and then <Change till={1}>supposedly added it back</Change><Change from={1}>agreed to add it back after a number of people protested</Change>. However, <Change till={1}>her activity dropped off and the word was never actually put back into the dictionary.</Change><Change from={1}>Sonja then went inactive for several months, and she did not actually add the word back into the dictionary before leaving.</Change> When she <Change till={1}>returned to active involvement</Change><Change from={1}>became active again</Change>, she <Change till={1}>no longer wanted the word</Change><Change from={1}>reasserted her old claim that the word should not exist</Change>.
So, _kan_ <Change till={1}>was used</Change> <Change from={1}>had been used</Change> for about a year even though it was unofficial. <Change till={1}>Anyhow, it meant "with" or "among" and can now be replaced by</Change> <Change from={1}>Today we replace it with</Change> _poka_.

**kapa** - This word designated any type of extrusion, such as a hill, mountain, or a button. Today, it has been replaced by _nena_, which seems to have the same meaning as _kapa_ once did. The reason and time of changing the word is unknown, but it is said to have happened very early. Of all the words that actually survived long enough to be presented online, this is the first one to be removed.

**kapesi** - Although the official definition might have been slightly different, the word basically meant "brown" or "grey<Change till={1}>".</Change><Change from={1}>."</Change> Today, you can replace it with _pimeja_. There is no known accurate removal date, although it was done sometime before September<Change till={1}>,</Change> 2002.

**leko** - This word, which means "stairs" or "square<Change till={1}>",</Change><Change from={1}>,"</Change> was removed in February 2004 when Sonja returned from a long absence.

**majuna** - This word <Change till={1}>never made it much farther than the idea stage.</Change> <Change from={1}>was conceived before Toki Pona was first presented online but was abandoned before the language reached the internet.</Change> It tenatively was to mean "old<Change till={1}>".</Change><Change from={1}>."</Change>

**pasila** - This word came along very early and died before Toki Pona was ever presented online. It was the early word that mean "good" or "easy<Change till={1}>",</Change><Change from={1}>,"</Change> and of course it was replaced by _pona_.

**pata** - This word, which means "sibling<Change till={1}>",</Change><Change from={1}>,"</Change> was removed in February 2004 when Sonja returned from a long absence. Sonja suggests using _jan sama_ now to reach the same meaning.

**po** - This word meant "four" at one time. <Change till={1}>It's unknown as to when this word was removed from the Toki Pona dictionary,</Change> <Change from={1}>The date of removal is unknown,</Change> although it must have been fairly early before Toki Pona was well-known. Today, you <Change till={1}>could</Change><Change from={1}>can</Change> replace it with _mute_, or, if absolutely necessary, _tu tu_.

**powe** - This word never made it off the drawing board. Its tenative meanings included: unreal, false, untrue, pretend, deceive, trick.

**tuli** - <Change till={1}>This was also a number word.</Change> <Change till={1}>It</Change><Change from={1}>This word</Change> meant three. Like <Change till={1}>four</Change><Change from={1}>_po_</Change>, <Change till={1}>it's unknown as to when this word was removed,</Change> <Change from={1}>we don't know when the word was dropped,</Change> although it must have been fairly early before Toki Pona was well-known. Today, you could replace it with "mute," or, if absolutely necessary, _tu wan_.
