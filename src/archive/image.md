These comics, made by a fellow named Russ Williams, are short and are black-and-white, but they're entertaining and very good. They're hosted on another site; click on each link to go to the comic. You'll have to use your back button to come back to this page.

With all due respect to the author of the comics, I think there is one minor error:
_In comic 6, use "tenpo ni li pona" instead of "olin e tenpo"._

## [Political Cartoons](/image/politic)
See how you can bash all your favorite world leaders using Toki Pona!

## [pipi Pu en len noka Nu](/image/pipipu)
This is a semi-simple comic featuring Pu, a bug, who tries to make his home in Nu, a shoe.

## [len pi toki pona](/image/shirt)
I made a Toki Pona shirt and took some shots on my digital camera. It's a nice shirt; check it out.

## [The Boudreaux Photo](/image/boudreaux)
In spring 2004, a picture (that's probably fake) turned up which showed a U.S. Marine standing beside two Iraqi boys, who are holding a sign which says, "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my dad then he knocked up my sister." Many people have made fake versions of this sign as a joke, and so I figured I'd translate it into Toki Pona.

## [Toki Pona Thanksgiving](/image/thanks)
The day before Thanksgiving, I got a little bored, so I decided to make some comics. Check them out.

## [Tribute to Palapiku](/image/palapiku)
This animation is a small tribute to Palapiku (For those of who you don't come to the Toki Pona chat room occasionally, Palapiku was a definition bot which would quickly translate a Toki Pona word on command). Click the link to be taken to the page where you can download the movie.

## [kasi nasa](/image/kasi)
These are some pictures honoring the famous little plant that helped create Toki Pona.

## [The Smiley Face Dude](/image/fame)
It seems that he's been spotted at places other than just tokipona.org!

## [Three Pona-Men](/image/pona)
This piece, created by Pije, shows a Klingon, an Elf, and Zamenhof (the creator of Esperanto) telling how they feel about Toki Pona.

## [Movie Poster for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers](/image/lotr2)
See the original movie poster, then compare it with the Toki Pona version.

## [Toki Pona Taught at Esperanto Festival](/image/eofest)
See pictures of Toki Pona being taught at the event.
