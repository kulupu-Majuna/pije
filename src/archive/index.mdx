<Change till={1}>toki! I hope you enjoy the material here on this site. However, keep in mind that I also have quite a few works and translations which, although they are very good and are great practice for Toki Pona, can't be put here on the internet for ... umm... various reasons. Email me if you're interested in getting a copy of some of these great works.</Change>
