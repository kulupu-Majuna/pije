| Heroes have graced the field before you: men with the hearts, bodies, and minds of which the entire Bulldog nation can be justifiably proud.                                                                                                                                            | tenpo pini la jan pona li lon ma ni. kon ona en sijelo ona en lawa ona li pona tawa jan Bulldog ali.                                                                                                                                                         | In the past, good people were on this field. Their spirits and their bodies and their minds are good to all Bulldog people.                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| A tradition of unbridled excellence demonstrated by these individuals and many others spans more than a full century.                                                                                                                                                                   | tenpo suli la jan ni en jan ante mute li pali e nasin pona.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | For a long time, these people and many other people created a good tradition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| And now a new breed of Bulldog stands ready to take the field of battle to assume the reigns of their Georgia forbearers and continue that tradition, understanding that there is no tradition more worth of envy, no institution worthy of such loyalty, as the University of Georgia. | tenpo ni la jan Bulldog sin li lon li wile utala lon ma ni. ona li wile lawa pona e nasin pi jan Georgia pi tenpo pini. ona li sona e ni: jan ante ali li wile e nasin sama nasin pi tomo sona Georgia. kulupu pi tomo sona Georgia li sewi kulupu ante ali. | Now, new Bulldogs are here and want to battle on this field. They want to guide well the traditions of the Georgia people of the past. They know this: All other people want a tradition like the tradition of the Georgia school. The community of the Georgia school is above all other communities. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| As we prepare for another meeting between the hedges, let all the Bulldog faithful rally behind the men who now wear the red and black with two words—two simple words which express the sentiments of the entire Bulldog nation: Go Dawgs!                                             | mi mute li kama tawa ma insa linja kasi. jan Bulldog pona ali o wan anpa jan pi len pi loje en pimeja. o toki e nimi tu--nimi tu ni li toki e pilin pi jan Bulldog ali: Go Dawgs!                                                                            | We come to the field between the lines of plants. All good Bulldogs, unite under the people of shirts of red and black. Say the two words—These two words say the feelings of all Bulldogs: Go Dawgs!                                                                                                  | "linja kasi" is intended to mean "hedges" but more literally means "line of plants." Two long, thin lines of shrubbery surround either side of the University's football field.<br/><br/> I decided not to translate "Go Dawgs!" The phrase has intense sentimental meaning, and I couldn't think of a suitable translation. |
