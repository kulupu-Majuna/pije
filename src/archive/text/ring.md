This is the popular poem from the Lord of the Rings that tells about the One Ring of Sauron. The translation below follows this pattern:
- <span class="original">Original English text</span>
- <span class="translation">Toki Pona translation</span>
- <span class="alt">A semi-literal translation back into English</span>

The poem uses three proper adjectives, one for each of the races mentioned in the poem. Here is an explanation of them:
- _Eta_ - from the Elvish word Eldar, which denotes those Elves who left from Cuiviénen  
- _Kasa_ - from the Khuzdul word Khazād, which means "Dwarves"  
- _Ana_ - from the Adūnaic word anā, which means "human being"  

And now for the translation:

<span class="original">Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,</span>  
<span class="translation">jan Eta sewi li jo e sike mute.</span>  
<span class="alt">The noble Eldar have many rings.</span>

<span class="original">Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,</span>  
<span class="translation">jan Kasa li jo e sike mute li lon tomo kiwen.</span>  
<span class="alt">The Dwarves have many rings (and) are in stone buildings.</span>

<span class="original">Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,</span>  
<span class="translation">jan Ana li jo e sike mute li moli.</span>  
<span class="alt">Humans have many rings and die.</span>

<span class="original">One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne</span>  
<span class="translation">jan lawa pimeja li jo e sike wan</span>  
<span class="alt">The dark leader has one ring</span>

<span class="original">In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</span>  
<span class="translation">li lon ma Moto pimeja.</span>  
<span class="alt">(and) is in the shadowy land of Mordor.</span>

<span class="original">One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</span>  
<span class="translation">sike wan li lawa e ali. sike wan li lukin e ma ali.</span>  
<span class="alt">The one ring controls everything. The one ring sees all countries.</span>

<span class="original">One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</span>  
<span class="translation">sike wan li kama jo e ali li wan e ali kepeken ike</span>  
<span class="alt">The one ring gets everything and unites everything using evil</span>

<span class="original">In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</span>  
<span class="translation">lon ma Moto pimeja.</span>  
<span class="alt">in the shadowy land of Mordor.</span>
