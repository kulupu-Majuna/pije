[July 1, 2002](chat020701) - A discussion on the essence of war and peace between Pije and Marraskuu, the creator of Toki Pona.

[July 2, 2003](chat030702) - Just some casual chat. It starts off talking about some points on translating the Lord of Rings poem, and then Marraskuu enters, and we all three talk for a few minutes in Toki Pona.

[January 15, 2004](chat040115) - TwiztedShaman and Pije have some casual chat almost entirely in Toki Pona. We talked about music a good deal.
