Everyone used the same, common language.  
People came from the road of the sun's approach and came to Shinar and stayed there.  
People said this: "Come! Let's make bricks. Let's warm them."  
Many people said this: "Come! Let's make many building and a big tower. The top of the tower will be in heaven. May our name become important! I don't want this: We are in many different lands."  
The Lord came down and saw the city and the tower.  
And the Lord said this: The people are in one area and use the same language and have made a tower. Now they can do many bad things.  
I want to go down and want to destroy the language of these many people. I want this: People don't understand the language of other people.  
The Lord caused this: People are in many lands and can't build buildings.  
The name of this city is Babel because of this: the Lord destroyed the language of everyone. <Change till={1}>From the city Babel, the</Change><Change from={1}>The</Change> Lord moved people to many lands<Change from={1}> from the city Babel</Change>.

 We know that race is religion.

We know that white people are very good. Other people are evil.

We know that if a person is good to the white people, that person is good. If a person harms the white people, that person is very evil.

We know that if a path is good for the white people, it is the ultimate good. If a path is bad for the white people, it is the ultimate evil.

We know that Creativity is the only religion for the white people. Only it can raise the white people.

We must be victorious. We work because of this.  
O holy war of the races!
