title: Translation of Wallace's Braveheart Speech
description: "If you've seen Braveheart, you might recollect this rousing speech.

> The original movie lines are <span class="original">orange</span>.  
> The Toki Pona translation is <span class="translation">white</span>.  
> During the speech, two soldiers from  
> the crowd cut in to say something;  
> these two lines are marked in <span class="original alt">blue</span>.

<span class="original">Sons of Scotland, I am William Wallace.</span>  
<span class="translation">jan Sukosi o, mi jan Wilijanwala.</span>  

<span class="original alt">William Wallace is seven feet tall.</span>  
<span class="translation">jan Wilijanwala li suli mute.</span>  

<span class="original">Yes, I've heard. Kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse.</span>  
<span class="translation">a. mi sona. ona li moli e jan mute. ona li lon la ona li pana e seli tan oko li pana e wawa tan monsi li moli e jan Inli.</span>  

<span class="original">I <b>AM</b> William Wallace!</span>  
<span class="translation">mi jan Wilijanwala kin!</span>  

<span class="original">And I see a whole army of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny.</span>  
<span class="translation">mi lukin e kulupu utala Sukosi suli. ona li wile weka e nasin Inli ike.</span>  

<span class="original">You have come to fight as free men, and free men you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you fight?</span>  
<span class="translation">sina kama sama jan pona. sina jan pona kin. pona li suli. sina wile ala wile utala?</span>  

<span class="original alt">Fight? Against that? No, we will run; and we will live.</span>  
<span class="translation">mi mute li wile ala utala e ni. mi tawa la mi moli ala.</span>  

<span class="original">Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll live -- at least a while.</span>  
<span class="translation">pona. sina utala la sina ken moli. sina tawa la sina moli ala. ... tenpo lili la sina moli ala.</span>  

<span class="original">And dying in your beds many years from now,</span>  
<span class="translation">tenpo mute li pini. sina kama moli lon supa lape.</span>  

<span class="original">would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that</span>   
<span class="translation">sina pilin ala pilin e ni?: tenpo suno ali li lili. sina wile ala wile e ni taso?: sina lon ma ni li ken toki e ni tawa jan Inli:</span>  

<span class="original">they may take our lives, but they'll never take... our freedom!</span>  
<span class="translation">sina ken moli e mi. taso sina ken ala anpa e pona mi!</span>

<span class="original">Alba gu bra!</span>  
<span class="translation">ma Sokusi a!</span>
