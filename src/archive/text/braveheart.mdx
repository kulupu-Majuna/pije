<span class="translation">jan Wilijanwala li suli mute.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">William Wallace is very big. </span></Change>

<span class="original">Yes, I've heard. Kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse.</span>  
<span class="translation">a. mi sona. ona li moli e jan mute. ona li lon la ona li pana e seli tan oko <Change from={1}>ona</Change> li pana e <Change from={2}>suno</Change> wawa tan <Change from={1}>lupa</Change> monsi <Change from={1}>ona</Change> li moli e jan Inli.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">Oh, I know. He kills many people. If he were here, he would emit fire from his eyes, emit powerful lights from his butthole, and kill the Englishmen. </span></Change>

<span class="original">I **AM** William Wallace!</span>  
<span class="translation">mi jan Wilijanwala kin!</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">I am William Wallace indeed!</span></Change>

<span class="original">And I see a whole army of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny.</span>  
<span class="translation">mi lukin e kulupu utala Sukosi suli. ona li wile weka e nasin Inli ike.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">I see a big Scottish militia. It wants to get rid of the evil English system. </span></Change>

<span class="original">You have come to fight as free men, and free men you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you fight?</span>  
<span class="translation">sina kama sama jan <Change till={1}>pona</Change><Change from={1}>ken</Change>. sina jan <Change till={1}>pona</Change><Change from={1}>ken</Change> kin. <Change till={1}>pona li suli.</Change> <Change from={1}>sina ken ala la sina pali e seme?</Change> sina wile ala wile utala?</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">You come like able men. You are able men indeed. If you aren't able, what do you do? Do you want to fight? </span></Change>

<span class="original alt">Fight? Against that? No, we will run; and we will live.</span>  
<span class="translation">mi mute li wile ala utala e ni. mi tawa <Change from={2}>weka</Change> la mi moli ala.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">We don't want to fight that. If I go away, I won't die. </span></Change>

<span class="original">Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll live -- at least a while.</span>  
<span class="translation">pona. sina utala la sina ken moli. sina tawa <Change from={2}>weka</Change> la sina moli ala. ... <Change from={2}>a.</Change> tenpo lili la sina moli ala.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">Okay. If you fight, you could die. If you go away, you won't die. ... Well, for a little while you won't die. </span></Change>

<span class="original">And dying in your beds many years from now,</span>  
<span class="translation">tenpo mute li pini. sina kama moli lon supa lape<Change from={1}> sina</Change>.</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal"></span>Much time passes. You are dying in your bed. </Change>

<span class="original">would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that</span>   
<span class="translation">sina pilin ala pilin e ni?: tenpo suno ali li lili. sina wile ala wile e ni taso?: sina lon ma ni li ken toki e ni tawa jan Inli:</span>  
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">Do you think this?: All the days were unimportant. Do you want only this?: You are in this field and can say this to the Englishmen: </span></Change>

<span class="original">they may take our lives, but they'll never take... our freedom!</span>  
<span class="translation">sina ken moli e mi. taso sina ken ala anpa e <Change from={1}>...</Change> <Change till={1}>pona</Change><Change from={1}>ken</Change> mi!</span>
<Change from={2}><span class="literal">You can kill me. But you can't suppress ... my ability! </span></Change>
