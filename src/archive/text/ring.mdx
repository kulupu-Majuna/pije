- _Eta_ - from the Elvish word Eldar, which <Change till={1}>denotes</Change> <Change from={1}>means</Change> those Elves who left from Cuiviénen  
- _Kasa_ - from the Khuzdul word Khaz<Change till={1}>ā</Change><Change from={1}>â</Change>d, which means "Dwarves"  
- _Ana_ - from the Ad<Change till={1}>ū</Change><Change from={1}>û</Change>naic word an<Change till={1}>ā</Change><Change from={1}>â</Change>, which means "human being"
