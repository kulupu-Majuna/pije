<u>iki</u> - This word still remains in the dictionary because it was once very common and still exists in some older texts. It is the older equivalent of the current word ona, meaning "he, she, it". As far as I can tell, this change occurred sometime around early June, 2002. The primary reason for changing the word was that iki was too similar to the word for "bad," _ike_.

<u>kan</u> - _kan_ is dead, but it certainly went down screaming and thrashing! Around the summer of 2003, Sonja removed this word and then supposedly added it back. However, her activity dropped off and the word was never actually put back into the dictionary. When she returned to active involvement, she no longer wanted the word. So, _kan_ was used for about a year even though it was unofficial. Anyhow, it meant "with" or "among" and can now be replaced by poka.

<u>kapa</u> - This word designated any type of extrusion, such as a hill, mountain, or a button. Today, it has been replaced by _nena_, which seems to have the same meaning as _kapa_ once did. The reason and time of changing the word is unknown, but it is said to have happened very early. Of all the words that actually survived long enough to be presented online, this is the first one to be removed.

<u>kapesi</u> - Although the official definition might have been slightly different, the word basically meant "brown" or "grey". Today, you can replace it with _pimeja_. There is no known accurate removal date, although it was done sometime before September, 2002.

<u>leko</u> - This word, which means "stairs" or "square", was removed in February 2004 when Sonja returned from a long absence.

<u>majuna</u> - This word never made it much farther than the idea stage. It tenatively was to mean "old".

<u>pasila</u> - This word came along very early and died before Toki Pona was ever presented online. It was the early word that mean "good" or "easy", and of course it was replaced by _pona_.

<u>pata</u> - This word, which means "sibling", was removed in February 2004 when Sonja returned from a long absence. Sonja suggests using _jan sama_ now to reach the same meaning.

<u>po</u> - This word meant "four" at one time. It's unknown as to when this word was removed from the Toki Pona dictionary, although it must have been fairly early before Toki Pona was well-known. Today, you could replace it with _mute_, or, if absolutely necessary, _tu tu_.

<u>powe</u> - This word never made it off the drawing board. Its tenative meanings included: unreal, false, untrue, pretend, deceive, trick.

<u>tuli</u> - This was also a number word. It meant three. Like four, it's unknown as to when this word was removed, although it must have been fairly early before Toki Pona was well-known. Today, you could replace it with "mute," or, if absolutely necessary, _tu wan_.
