It should come as no surprise that a little plant has had a huge impact on the creation of the Toki Pona. In fact, some of the best ideas about Toki Pona were thought up while under the influence of kasi nasa (or referred to as kasi sona when used for "meditation".) Whereas kasi nasa has distinguished itself by inspiring Toki Pona so greatly, it deserves a place of recognition here. Therefore, I have put together a few pictures, modelled after the famous "got milk?" advertisements, that pay tribute to the little plant.
