title: The Boudreaux Photo
description: In spring 2004, a picture (that's probably fake) turned up which showed a U.S. Marine standing beside two Iraqi boys, who are holding a sign which says, "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my dad then he knocked up my sister." Many people have made fake versions of this sign as a joke, and so I figured I'd translate it into Toki Pona.
