You probably already know that the Toki Pona smiley dude spends most of his days relaxing at tokipona.org. However, would you believe that he _also_ has been spreading his message of _pona_ in other places, too? In fact, he has been one of the most influential people of all history. Whenever something _pona_ happened in the world, chances are that the Toki Pona smiley dude was there. To prove it, I'd like you take a close, second look at these images below. They are pictures of famous events, and you've probably seen them before; however, if you look carefully, you'll see something new!

Well, that's all for now. Tune in next time to see how the smiley dude saved mankind, cut down a tree using nothing but a herring, and managed to listen to an entire album by Barbra Streisand... all at the same time!
