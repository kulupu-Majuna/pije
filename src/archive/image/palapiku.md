title: '"moli pi ilo Palapiku"'
description: This animation is a small tribute to Palapiku (For those of who you don't come to the Toki Pona chat room occasionally, Palapiku was a definition bot which would quickly translate a Toki Pona word on command).

This animation features a short eulogy for Palapiku (both spoken aloud and written on the screen for you to see), as well as a few other stylish introductory and closing techniques.

To view this file, you'll need to have Windows Media Player or something else that can play `.WMV` files.

I hope you enjoy this tribute to Palapiku.
