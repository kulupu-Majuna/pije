 Toki Pona has this occasional habit of popping up in unexpected places. It seems that Toki Pona has been taught a few times at a conference in Vermont: [message 288 of the Yahoo TP board](https://kulupu-majuna.github.io/yahoo/threads/t20). Just recently, at the end of 2003, someone informed me that Toki Pona had been taught at an Esperanto conference and showed me these pictures of the event:

The teacher is said to be Oleg, who has a page in Russian about Toki Pona. You can visit that page [here](http://www.lingvisto.org/tokipona/index.html), but remember that it's only in Russian.

For some reason, information about these events always seems to be hazy. If you have information about any other TP events, e-mail me about them, and I can talk about them on this page.
