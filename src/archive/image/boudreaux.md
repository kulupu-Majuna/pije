title: The Boudreaux Photo
description: In spring 2004, a picture (that's probably fake) turned up which showed a U.S. Marine standing beside two Iraqi boys, who are holding a sign which says, "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my dad then he knocked up my sister." Many people have made fake versions of this sign as a joke, and so I figured I'd translate it into Toki Pona.

Back in spring 2004, a picture was found on the internet; it showed a U.S. Marine with two Iraqi boys, one of whom was holding a sign which read "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my dad then he knocked up my sister."

Boudreaux claims that the sign originally said "Welcome Marines", and that the picture is a fake made by someone on the computer. There are many different versions of this photo. After the story got into the news, for a few months there was even a website where you could make your own fake version of the sign and write in anything you wanted on it. The picture was investigated by the Pentagon and the Marine Corps, but there's no way to prove whether the picture is real or fake.

If you want to, you can see ![the sign in English](https://web.archive.org/web/20041209223706/http://www.cair-net.org/images/lcpl11.jpg). For fun, I've translated the sign into Toki Pona:
