Below is a shot of the front. As you can see, it has a big picture of the Toki
Pona smiley dude and under his picture it says "toki pona li toki pona"
(Toki Pona is a good language).

Next is the shot of the back, and in English it reads:

> "Life is wonderful. Sunlight and trees and fruits  
> make people happy. Toki Pona  
> is a language of nature. Learn it!"
