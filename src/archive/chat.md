There is a Toki Pona chat room.

If you have an IRC client:  
  The network is irc.freenode.org  
  The channel name is tokipona.

If you don't have an IRC client:  
  Go [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/).  
  In the "Nickname" box, type in whatever name you want.  
  In the "Channels" box, type in tokipona.  
  Press the connect button.  
  Wait a few seconds for the chat room to appear.

The chat room is usually fairly quiet. It's best to join the chat room, then just leave the chat window open on your computer. You'll eventually meet up with someone.

I am in the chat room often, so drop by and say _toki!_
