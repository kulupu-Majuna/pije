<Change till={1}>Below is a chart of the symbols used for the Toki Pona mode of tengwar. If you'd like to you can [download the font](/files/tokitengwar.zip) which contains all of these symbols. In the chart below, under each of the symbols, you will see what button to type on your keyboard to make the tengwar letters if you have the font.</Change>

<Change from={1}>Before I proceed to describe how to use the Toki Pona mode of Tengwar, I want to point out that you can [download the font](/files/tokitengwar.zip) that is designed for writing tengwar in Toki Pona. Below you can see a chart showing all the characters in the font</Change>

If you are familiar with the tengwar of J. R. R. Tolkien, this should be a breeze for you. If not, don't fear: I will explain it fully for you and give some examples.

 

## Instructions

The vowel signs always come above the consonant which precedes them. <Change till={1}>Let's look at a few examples:</Change>

<Change till={1}> 
![](/images/tengwar/kasi.jpg)
</Change>

<Change till={1}>The</Change><Change from={1}>For example, the</Change> word for **plant** in Toki Pona is _kasi_.
<Change from={1}>In tengwar, you can write it <img src="/images/tengwar/kasi.jpg" class="inline"/></Change>
As you can see, the _a_ <Change from={1}>(<img src="/images/tengwar/a.jpg" class="inline"/>)</Change> which comes after the _k_ <Change from={1}>(<img src="/images/tengwar/k.jpg" class="inline"/>)</Change> has
its vowel sign written <u>above</u> the _k_. Also, the _i_ is
written above the s.


Some words begin with vowels, however. You can't put the vowel
sign above the consonant, because there is no consonant. <Change from={1}>In tengwar you can write it <img src="/images/tengwar/akesi.jpg" class="inline"/>.</Change> <Change till={1}>Here's what to do in that situation:</Change>

<Change till={1}>

![](/images/tengwar/akesi.jpg)

> akesi â€” reptile

</Change>


<Change till={1}>If</Change><Change from={1}>As you can see, if</Change> the vowel does not have a consonant before it, you place the
vowel sign on a separate line, which looks like an undotted i.
If you are using the Toki Pona tengwar font, type _q_ to make
the undotted-i figure..

 

The next thing you should know is that sometimes, you can't use the normal
symbol for _n_. If the _n_ comes at the end of a syllable (such as in _tenpo_,
_sitelen_, and _anpa_) rather than at the beginning (such as in _nimi_, _noka_, and
_pona_), you will need to put a special line over the previous consonant (or
the previous undotted-i stem) that represents an _n_. Here are the words _tenpo_,
_sitelen_, and _anpa_:

With the font, to make the horizontal bar which represents _n_, type _N_. Also,
you can use a tilde rather than a bar if you choose to do so. They both mean
the same thing. Type M for the tilde.

To make a sentence using the Toki Pona mode of tengwar, there must be a : at the beginning and end of the sentence. 
To make a question or use an exclamation mark, simply add their symbols next to the final : of the sentence. 
<Change from={1}>So that you can understand these instructions better, here</Change><Change till={1}>Here</Change> are three sentences in Toki Pona using tengwar. The first is a normal sentence, the second is a question, and the third an exclamation:

![](/images/tengwar/sentence.jpg)

The only time you can omit the period is if you would rather put a paragraph
marker in its place. The paragraph markers are optional, and you can use it
however you choose to. To make the paragraph markers, type <Change till={1}>either</Change> ` <Change till={1}>or ~</Change>


The last thing<Change from={1}>s</Change> you should know are just a few miscellaneous topics<Change till={1}>.</Change><Change from={1}>:</Change> 

<Change till={1}>If you want to put either a hyphen or a comma into your writing, they both are the same symbol in the Toki Pona mode of tengwar. Simply type either , or - to make the symbol. Note that if you use a comma, you should not put a space after it, like you would normally do in English writing. To make quotation marks, you can type ' and " if you have the font. The ' symbol is the opening quotation, and the " symbol is the closing quotation.</Change>

<Change till={1}><img /> {/* tengwar/end.jpg*/}</Change>

<Change from={1}>If you want to put a colon into your writing, it looks like a period that has been raised up a little. If you're using the font, simply type , to make the appropriate symbol. (I acknowledge that having to remember to type , instead of : when you want to write the colon is a bit less obvious. But it is easier to type , than it is to type :.).</Change>

<Change from={1}>To make quotation marks, you can type ' and " if you have the font. The ' symbol is the opening quotation, and the " symbol is the closing quotation.</Change>

<Change from={1}>
## Automatic text-to-tengwar conversion
As you can probably tell from reading the instructions above, you have to make a number of changes to normal, typed Toki Pona text to convert the text to properly used tengwar. For example, you would have to change the word _en_ to _qeN_ in the TokiTengwar font if you want to write the word properly. To save you from having to go through all the trouble of manually editing your text, Lament (one of Toki Pona's fluent speakers) has made a script that will automatically make the necessary changes.

Type the Toki Pona text that you want to convert into tengwar into the box below. When you're done, hit the **Convert** button.

<script src="/js/tengwar.js"></script>
<textarea rows="10" cols="70" id="input"></textarea><br/>
<button onclick="convert()">Convert</button>

After you hit the **Convert** button, below you will see your converted text. Copy-paste this text into your word processor, switch its font to TokiTengwar, and presto! You now have your text written correctly in the Toki Pona mode of tengwar.

<small>Your converted text appears here:</small><br/>
<output id="output"></output>

Some notes about the converted text:
> The convertor automatically assumes you are writing a sentence. If you want to write just a name or a word, remove the periods that appear at the beginning and end of the phrase.

> The convertor does not distinguish between open and closed quotation marks. If you want to use quotations in your text, you must manually change the opening quotation mark to '.
