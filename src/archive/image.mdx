### [The Boudreaux Photo](/image/boudreaux)
<Change till={1}>In spring 2004, a picture (that's probably fake) turned up which showed a U.S. Marine standing beside two Iraqi boys, who are holding a sign which says, "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my dad then he knocked up my sister." Many people have made fake versions of this sign as a joke, and so I figured I'd translate it into Toki Pona.</Change>

_In comic 6, use "tenpo ni li pona" instead of "olin e tenpo"._
